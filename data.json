As the day wore on toward evening and he didn't come back at the expected time, Ed scanned upriver and across the adjacent land with binoculars. There he saw a sasquatch walking across the tundra, with long, smooth steps and with dark hair flowing from its shoulders, bouncing behind \"like a cape\" at every step. The sasquatch paid no attention to the boat (distance about 1,000').",

      "OBSERVED": "heh i kinda feel a little dumb that im reporting this but its bothering me so here goes.. bout a month ago i was with a friend and her son, we were hanging out at a camp ground by Allamuchy state park, in Warren county NJ. i think the camp ground was part of Stephens state park either way it was on the Musconetcong river. it was late in the day and we were just walking on the trials by the river. we figured since her son was gonna stay with her folks that evening we would come back later and spend the night at the camp ground. we went home and got together some gear, just sleeping bags and sleeping pads. we stopped at a store got some hotdogs and rolls and a gallon of water then headed to the camp site. it was about 10pm when we got to the camp site and i think we took spot 19. it was close to the road one of the last spots before ya hit the road maybe 50 yards or so. we made a fire in the metal fire ring and just sat around till about 1am, there were maybe 5 or 6 sites that were camped that night one was taken by some boy scouts. at about 1am my friend got in her sleeping bag next to the fire, i was still up drinking hot chocolate and stareing into the fire, about 20min or so later i got into my bag next to her and was lieing on my side looking into the woods. i wasnt comfortable and i laid awake for a good hour or so just thinking and listening to the sounds of the woods and the river that was 100yards tops away from me. then i heard a sound like someone was lightly banging a fork or something against a plate. i thought maybe a bear was snooping around looking for a free meal, this is bear country and we have a very healthy black bear population, but maybe 30 seconds after i heard the metalic sound i heard someone or something bang a branch against a tree 4 or 5 times in a row, i thought that the bear maybe was getting a little to close to someones camp site. then i again heard banging against a tree but this time it was a bout 100yards into the woods and not near any camping area that i had seen in the daylight. then the tree banging came from the first spot as if answering the other position. the first tree banger was what seemed to be on or near the road by the middle of the camp ground. that kinda made my mind wander i was wondering what was going on..and who is up making all this noise. about 10minutes later i looked into the woods which were slightly iluminated by my dieing fire and i saw what looked like a bear looking into my camp about 20 feet away from behind a tree. i saw just the shadowy outline of it. i could see its head and shoulders slowly move out from behind the tree look in and then move back behind the tree. ive seen bears do this before in the day light but never this close. then i closed my eyes waited a few seconds and opened them just to make sure i wasnt seeing things. but this whatever it was had difined shoulders and a rounded kinda pointy on top head, it didnt have and ears like you would see on a bear, nor the flat head of a bear and if it was a bear its front arms wouldnt have given it the squared off shoulders that i was seeing in the silloette of this figure. i got kinda scared for a few moments and didnt move a at all. i thought for a second about jumping up and yelling at it but i didnt want so get it mad at me or scare it. i closed my eyes and tried my hardest just to fall asleep. i dozed off finally and was awoken by my friend who was yelling at me for not putting the bag of hotdogs in the car before going to sleep. we had in the bag a apple and a orange, rolls and a unopend pack of hotdogs, i tied the bag with a simple knot like you would tigh your shoes the night before, but when i got up the only thing left where the bag was, was the orange just sitting there on the ground. my friend said somthing along the lines of wow a bear came and stole our hotdogs. i kinda was wondering what was going on so i decided to have a look around where i saw the figure the night before, i remembered that the shadowy figure was hiding behind the tree and i could see a branch just above its head maybe a foot or so higher than the top of the figure. it was puzzleing because that branch must have been 8 or 9 feet off the ground and black bears where i come from dont stand that tall on there hind feet. i didnt try to tell her what i heard or saw the night before because she wouldnt have belived me anyway, but ive spend lots of time in the back country and woods hunting, fishing, rock climbing, and backpacking. i know what bears look like up close as well as from a distance. and this wasnt a bear and to tall for a person. i didnt smell anything but i think i was up wind anyway and we were burning wood in the fire and all i could really smell was the fire anyway. the thing that really bothers me is the tree banging its was allmost like something was comunicating with something else. it also bothers me that something waited until it was sure that i was asleep before coming into camp. in which case it woulda been 6 or 7 feet from where we were sleeping in order to open the bag and have a look in it, then disguard the orange and take the rest bag and all. it wouldve had to make some sound if it just tore the bag opened. i looked around before we left to see if i could find any tracks or anything but the ground is was just to hard, there was a few game trails but i didnt look very far or spend alot of time looking. i looked on the internet and found this sight and was surprized to see other sitings in new jersey.",

The creature came out of the reeds and was crouched down looking at me through them. Surprisingly it got out of the reeds from crouched to standing turned around and ran towards the wooded area up a hill and was moving with it's arms brush and tree branches out of the way. It was incredibly fast runner and I got a good look at its coconut shaped head as it ran away. It was light brown/brown. It had incredibly broad shoulders. I went back the same day. The marsh went up to my knees and I could smell a bad odor like garbage. Myself and a friend went back to the sighting. We found a footprint and a hair sample. I could hear wood knocks when my friend James did a call and we also found a large bed of branches and some tree structures.

      "OBSERVED": "I was northeast of Macy Nebraska along the Missouri River taking part in an expedition hosted by members of the Omaha Indian tribe. We were on the Omaha Reservation.  These tribal members say they've had many sightings in the hilly bluff zone extending for miles along the west flank of the Missouri River Basin. Five of us had decided to take a day hike to see a possible “X” structure. As we started up the path it became known that to get to the “X” we’d have to veer off the main path and bushwhack through the weeds. Two people did this while three of us decided to stay on the clearer but muddy path. (I still have never seen this \"X\" but pictures are available.) As we headed up the trail one of my Native American companions said he was hearing movement in the woods to our right. At this point we could not see very far off the path as trees and brush blocked the view. I did not hear the movement. We continued forward and came to an area where trees had been cut down in the past. We could see maybe 40-50 yards back into the forest. Two of us looked to our right as soon as we made it to this clearer area and immediately saw movement. I saw a long light brown object that was swinging downward from a horizontal position toward. It was not indicative of any other animal that I can think of and was bent slightly at an apparent elbow. I could not see a hand because of the brush. At the time of the sighting the other witness started telling us what HE just saw. He said “I just saw one” and described seeing the whole upper body of a light brown Sasquatch. Apparently when it noticed us it started to drop down and move to its right (our left) behind cover. He said as it was ducking down the arm had swung way up in the air and back down, and he demonstrated. His description and demonstration exactly matched what I had seen. He did not know that I had also seen it as he was telling me his story. I took a picture of the area where the sighting happened. This subject was behind and to the right of a stick pointing upward. On July 27th 2018, I revisited the location with BFRO investigator T. Bell and hacked my way back into this spot. We determined that the top of the stick is about 11 feet high, making the top of the swinging ‘arm’ at around 9 feet tall. On the day of the sighting I was not prepared to bushwhack back into the site where the subject was seen. I was better prepared when we returned on July 27th. I have already done an interview with the BFRO investigator just after our recreation attempt. This subject was MUCH larger than me. It could very easily be 10 + feet as it was already ducking away when I saw it.",

Whilecoming back from a hunting trip outside of Minot, North Dakota in aroundthe third week of April, in 1962, a friend of mine and I were followedby a creature as we returned in the direction of the trailer park in whichwe lived. (My father was working for the Department of the Air Force onthe Missile site Installations at the time.) After walking back from somedistance out on the prairie, I had the distinct feeling that someone orsomething was following us. Eventually I became so uncomfortable that Idid look over my right shoulder and saw at a distance of about 50 yardsor so, what I thought at first was a great ape. I cannot describe to youwhat I felt at that moment. It fixed me with it's eyes and stood up onit's hind legs when it saw that it had been seen. As all I had was a singleshot .22, shooting it was out of the question. I got a real good closelook, long black shiny hair, oily looking, and it rose from all fours onto it's hind feet.(I am certain it had followed us for some time). Verytall. No hair on the face above it's nose or the palms of it's hands. Longarms. Very malevolent expression conveyed to me. I cannot overemphasizethis. It began to move in our direction. (I was with a partner). Both ofus ran as fast as we could. We didn't look back after this.",

      "LOCATION_DETAILS": "Yancey County, North Carolina, near the summit of Mt. Mitchell",
      "OBSERVED": "In early spring 1988, some friends of mine and I were traveling up the road to the top of Mt. Mitchell in a four-wheel drive vehicle. Mt. Mitchell is the highest peak east of the Mississippi River at 6,684 feet, and as a result, the mountain gets heavy snowfalls well into March and sometimes April. There had been some heavy snowfall in the weeks preceding our drive, and there were some deep snowdrifts piled up alongside the road, although the road had only a dusting of light snow on its surface. Almost no one goes up on the mountain in the wintertime, and as I remember it, we had to skirt our way around a barricade to even get on the road to the summit. We reached the top of the mountain, then turned around to drive back down. About a half mile below the summit, we went around a sharp, left-hand turn, and our headlights hit the steep bank beside the road. In the snow on the bank we could see several deep impressions that led up the bank and into the woods. We got out and examined the marks, but it was dark and we couldn't tell much about them. The next day, we drove back up and looked at the marks in the daylight. The tracks, as we took them to be, were in deep snow, and we could see mud at the bottom of them and measured the depth of the snow at 18 inches.  In the two tracks closest the road, there were faint outlines that could have been toe marks, but there were no claw marks visible as with bear tracks. The prints were apparently made by a bipedal animal, and led up a steep bank and disappeared over the top of the bank about 75 yards up the slope.  The bank beside the road was extremely steep, and it took my friend, who is 6-2 and athletic, eight long strides to climb the bank, but whatever left the prints needed only two steps. At one point, the animal had stepped over a fallen branch approximately three feet off the ground without breaking stride. I know sometimes big cats can leave footprints that appear to be two-legged, and there are still some panthers (mountain lions) left in the mountains of North Carolina, but if a cat made these marks it would have to have been the biggest panther in the world. They were about 14 inches long and seven inches wide. We thought perhaps the marks could have been made by clumps of snow falling from trees, but there were marks where there were no overhanging branches. We split up that day and two different groups walked along the road about a mile in each direction from the prints, but we never found where the animal had crossed the road, which means it was obviously using the road for traveling instead of trudging through the deep snow.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "When we split up and walked along the road, we found dozens of deer tracks and several spots beside the road where deer had bedded. That isn't unusual for this area, but it did indicate there was some wildlife in the area.",

      "OBSERVED": "This happened summertime early 70's (I think 71, 72?).   Me, my husband at the time, and my two brothers hiked into Lilly Pad and Crater Lakes, Stillwater County, Montana.  It borders Custer National Forest, north of the East Fork of Fiddler Creek. There were no other cars in the parking lot so absolutely there was no one else up in that area or encountered.  It is a very remote and high mountainous area.  Lilly Pad is full of lilly pads, per its name.  At the time I thought it strange that we didn't see any moose there. When we left Lilly Pad, we climbed the side of the mountain, a very rocky narrow trail (just a game trail) towards Crater Lake.  Near the top, I kept hearing tree branches break, and thought, huh, the forest sure is noisy.  At the top we stepped into an open plateau (in looking at a current Google map, this area is now forested with trees) . We hadn't gone far when I heard a very loud tree knock coming from the upper end of the  plateau, on the side of the mountain. I could pinpoint exactly where the sound came from. It was NOT a tree branch falling. It was a wood knock, obviously wood on wood, a very sharp cracking sound, kind of like a baseball bat hitting a ball only LOUD. I said, \"What in the world was that?\"  One of my bro's said \"loggers\".  Wrong, there was no one up in there and there was no evidence of logging.  Almost immediately following that knock I got the feeling we weren't alone. We crossed the plateau and at the end there was a slight curve taking us to the lake. This area was also open but more of a corridor, maybe 100' or less wide. We fished the SE end of the lake and then one by one started making our way up and around the lake on the south side.  When I got towards the upper end there was a horrible stench and my hair literally started to crawl.  I remember being surprised at the smell. Being close to Yellowstone Park I would have expected a sulphur smell but this was not that; it was a stench like I've never smelled before or since. There was an open area around the lake, maybe 30-50' or so and then heavy brush.   I hurried up and around the lake back to where the guys were.  My older bro and husband would not go back up around, my younger bro started a second trip.  I had no inclination or want to go back around but then convinced myself if he is going, I must have imagined the feeling.  So I started another round.  Got up there and same thing, the stench made me want to gag (it seemed stronger the second time around) and my hair was standing on end.  I would cast and try to glance behind me to see what was there.  And then pine cones started landing next to me!  I would hear a rustle, and a pine cone would land next to me. These were NOT falling off the trees. The trees were too far away and these were coming in sideways and consistently landing right next to me.  My hair was really crawling. I was terrified.  But I didn't want to go back towards the guys, it was shorter if I continued around the end and that would put more space between me and it, whatever it was.  I pretended to keep fishing, and glancing over my shoulders afraid if I confronted it, it would attack.  And I kept glancing at the ground for tracks to see if I could figure out what it was.  At first I thought, oh it's too trampled to tell, and it was, right at the lake edge.  But when I looked towards the bushes and trees right at that upper end, there were 2 sets of huge tracks, one set coming, one evidently going back towards the trees.   The grass there was probably 8-12\" tall and it was smashed down where the footprints were.  I didn't see the actual foot imprints as in mud, just smashed down grass.  Had I not been so terrified I would have looked for toe prints etc but I was taking fast looks.  And of course expecting tracks like a moose or something, not what I saw. At that point I seriously sped up and went around the lake. On the other side there was a place where the lake indented into the trees a bit. I seriously thought about trying to wade across it but it was too deep and I can't swim, as I did NOT want to go into those trees.  Got back to the guys and they were grabbing their stuff and in a hurry to leave.  I said my skin is crawling up there, my younger bro said, yes there's something up there.  We headed out and I knew something was watching us.  It shadowed us until we got back off that plateau. I knew as soon as we hit that rocky trail it wasn't following us anymore. Thru the years I have searched my brain as to what it could have been and nothing fit:  grizzly would have been on us, black bear would have either came at us or run, moose wouldn't smell, mountain lion would watch us but you wouldn't know it was there and also wouldn't smell.  Quite frankly there wasn't an animal that would break tree branches, do a wood knock, or toss pine cones.  Once the bigfoot shows started airing and I heard the eyewitness accounts, I realized what it was.  There simply is no other explanation. I believe there were at least 2 of them, the one breaking the branches and may then have went ahead of us and did the tree knock, possibly to warn a second one that was messing around at the water's edge. My older bro does not remember that trip, my younger bro barely remembers going there. I'm divorced from that husband so who knows what he remembers. I wish I had had the courage to stand and stare at those bushes longer and even walk towards them, I believe it would have stood up. Incidentally there is a recent report with pictures on the BFRO website about a sighting near Red Lodge, Montana, which is relatively close to the area of my encounter.  And somewhere I saw a report of encounters around a \"small town in Carbon County\", a lady and her small daughter would regularly be visited by a family of bigfoots.  The little girl said the small ones don't smell, just the big ones.  I can't find that report again but would really be interested if that is close to where I had my encounter.",

The day before these tracks appeared my daughter-in-law and I had hiked about a mile up the gulch looking for deer tracks. In backtracking the tracks of the two creatures we found that they had come upon our tracks at the head of the gulch and had followed them back to the  house and that the larger of the two had gone all around the house, barn and fields below the house. The smaller one stayed out by the rabbit hutches and had curiously curled feet.  The larger creatures prints measured 17 inches and the smaller one's prints measured 14 1/2 inches around the curved foot. We took pictures of the prints and the thing that struck us most about prints was that the creatures had to have been massive as it was very cold and the snow and ice on the ground was frozen so hard that we could jump up and down without breaking through to the ground, but every print of both creatures went completely through the ice.

      "OBSERVED": "i want to start this off by saying, I don't know what I saw. I know it wasnt a bear. Having said that I don't know what to think. I am attaching a google doc that has pictures of what we found... So this last Saturday at about 12:30 my hunting partner and I went to Smittle cave conservation area to scout and see what conservation has cleared. We crossed a creek bottom to where there are small food plots. Once we crossed to the other side of the field we saw something on the trail about 150 to 200 yards off. even from that distance I could see it was big. I noted a head by a limb that I judged was maybe 5 or six feet of the ground. what we saw then crouched and sort of swayed a few times before taking off to the right and stopping. not being sure what we saw we crossed into the next field and discussed what it was, we turned around and went back to the field we had seen the creature and it was gone. We crossed back to where it had been and found a large fresh footprint. I put my foot down next to the print. I wear a size 10 1/2 and the print is way bigger than my foot. We estimate it to be 16 or 18 inches long.  In that same area we found broken trees that had been pulled up and then wove between other trees. What does that? Also the limb we thought was maybe five or six feet off the ground was more like 8 foot maybe 9. What we saw was big and when it moved it almost glided. It was dark gray with brown hair, it was bipedal. I couldn't make out facial features or say 100 percent what it was. We were too far away.",

      "OBSERVED": "A friend and I were Bowhunting in October of 2000 or 2001.We found the area we wanted to hunt the day before.We hiked into the woods together.He chose a spot down by the creek over looking a small swampy area.It was down a deep ravine.I continued on further down the path and found a spot and sat down in the tall grass.Neither one of us had a tree stand. I had sat down for a couple of hours and was awaiting the time my friend and I call \"Crunch Time\". That is the time when the wind usually calms down and Deer start to move.Off to my left I could hear what sounded like an animal moving very quietly.I'd like to add that where I sat there was a small hill between me and the spot where I had hoped to ambush a Deer.This animal kept quietly rustling about and I moved from a sitting position to a crouch, getting ready for a shot.All of a sudden a very large tree started to shake violently and whatever this animal was let out a roar/scream that scared the hell out of me.I could see up into the tree and saw nothing in the tree. I could not see the bottom of the tree as it was obscured by the small hill. I immediately got up and ran all the way back to the truck.When I arrived at the truck two DNR officers were waiting to probably check our licenses.One of the officers was a male the other a female.The officers questioned me why I was running. I told them what happened and also told them that my friend was still in the woods.One of the Officers unsnapped his holster but did not pull out his gun.At this time it was dark we walked into the woods looking for my friend.After a short walk we could see his flashlight. The first words out of his mouth were, \"Did you hear that thing scream\". I told him that I did. He also elaborated that immediately after the scream two deer ran through the swampy area at full speed.We all walked out of the woods together with the officers instructing us to leave. They didn't even bother checking our licenses. They were at a loss to explain what had happened.I have since bought a trailer down the road in Manistee County and am in the area quite a bit.In looking back the thing that scares me the most is the fact that this powerful animal was very stealth until it wanted me to know it was there.The area also has legendary creature known as the Dog Man.",

About an hour or so after camping I could hear movement near the tent but was not too concerned because there is a lot of wildlife in the barrens.The movement got closer and there was this really pungent order.I thought \"uh-oh it's a bear\"but was still not concerned as black bears are mostly just curious and usually will not bother you. I should add here that I have spent a lot of time in the woods as my mother and father were both Maine guides and the woods was my life.I have heard all the noises that wildlife makes in different seasons.I consider myself a good tracker and know the habits etc. of most animals. Then it happened:Whatever it was let out a scream that made every hair on my body stand striaght out and nearly gave me a heart attack.I am saying to myself\"this is no bear.\"Now the girlfriend is awake and in hysterics.I am trying to quiet her so I can keep track of whatever it is.It moved close enough to the tent so I could actually feel it's movement through the ground and hear it breathing.This activity went on for about 20 minutes and it went away. After a sleeplees night and at first light I crawled out to investigate.I looked for tracks.There were no clear imprints,only impessions in the grass and some broken ferns etc.The impessions were about half again as big as my own.I wear a size 11.I followed the tracks and they ended at a cliff that was about 30 feet high.I wanted to investigate further but the girlfriend was haveing none of it and wanted to leave.I went back a couple of times by myself to that area but never found any further signs in the area. This all would have been disturbing enough but that year I was liesurly sipping a beer an watching a documentry on bigfoot with my girlfriend when they played a recording that was supposed to be a bigfoot scream.YOu guessed it...Hair straight out and and an exclamation from both of us of \"Oh sh--!\"If that was bigfoot then we have been very close to him.",

      "OBSERVED": "I'd like to make a report, however it was years ago but I remember every part pretty well. I told a few folks about this over the years and they think I was nuts. But doesn't matter what they think. I was close enough to know what it was. I would say about less than 50 ft. Right in the middle of a fire road. In December 1977, my dad, uncle and my dad's other friends and myself went up to the cabin owned by a hunters club in Gardner, Mass. We went to spend the night, cook food and my dad and his friends like to play cards after eating supper. Myself and a friend used the snowmobile with a sled attached to the back, we took turns driving the ski doo around and the other would stand on the foot rest on the sled. The area was in northern central Massachusetts, very close to New Hampshire boarder. The cabin is in Ashburnham Mass. It's about 2.5 miles up a fire road called Old Colony Road. I remember it was a snowy winter that year. The area where we saw this thing was right on the edge of a swamp, old train tracks run right thru the area and crosses the fire road that we used to get to the cabin. It was about 4 p.m. or so, it was just getting a little dark. My friend and I left the cabin with the snowmobile, he was driving first and I was on the foot rest on the sled. We left and came up to the swamp, crossed over the tracks and headed down the road about 50 ft or so. It was getting a little late and we decided to not go to far so we turned the sled around on the road. Had to pick it up because of the narrowness of the road. Once we turned it around it was my turn to drive. So now were facing the tracks and the swamp is on both sides of the road. the road goes right thru the swamp and the tracks cross right by the edge of the swamp. At this point I looked behind me to see if my friend was on the sled and holding on, when I looked up I saw this creature walking on 2 legs like a human. He crossed right by the tracks at the edge of the swamp and crossed the road right in front of us. I remember it looking at us and I remember the arms swing clearly. Just like the pictures I have seen from your site. Very similar. Anyway, I remember the its size, that's what was scarey, so large, I'd say about 7to 9 ft high, weight about 400 to 500 pounds. At least for something that size it would most likely be heavy. I know the woods there well. I've spent years in the military and hunt every year. I have been trained in tracking and survival in the woods so I know what I am saying and what I saw. But the thing took about 2 steps and he was across the road. All black hair, didn't notice any smells, but I can tell you this. I won't forget that day ever. It was cold anyway and with no breeze the smell of it wouldn't travel far. My friend was shocked. He won't even mention it when I see him these days. He told one person and they treated him like he was on drugs. So thats why I never wanted to tell to many people. I wanted to say something about it now because I just say a program on TV the other night about bigfoot and the Kiamichi Mountians, I think in Oklahoma or somewhere out there. I remember one other thing that might be relevant. That being noises I have been hearing over the years in the woods there. Something like a crying sound but so load it almost seemed as if it were close by. I think it was a ways away because when we heard the sounds it was late, about midnight. We sit by the fireplace outside the cabin sometimes late cooking steak or deer meat on the grill. Behind the cabin is a huge swamp area that goes up to Route 12 in Ashburnham, Mass. The swamp is down a bit behind the cabin. We find moose droppings back there and lots of tree scraps from deer. I beleive there passing thru that area at times. Those sounds I heard were never heard there before and I don't hear them now when I go up there. Every now and then they seem to come back, but only when were outside sitting by the fire. Strange indeed. These woods go far as well and you could easily travel them and end up in New Hampshire or further without seeing a house. As time goes by and the more I read about what other folks saw and the similarities between each story I'm more wanting to do some of my own investigating, but its very scary out there at night, especially for me. I carry a loaded .44 when I'm up there just because I have seen this thing up close enough to know what it was. No doubt in my mind.",

The time was probably close to dusk, there was still a little bit of daylight left. The next thing that I remember was that my mother said\" that it was awful quiet outside all of a sudden.\" Then we heard the dog, start howling and scratching to get into the house, which was remarkable in its' own rights because this dog was tied to a stake in the yard. This was a Big German Shepard that had to be tied up because if he ran loose, he had a nasty habit of killing any animal he crossed paths with. Anyway as soon as my mother opened the door to let the dog in, the dog literally knocked her over and went immediately into the bedroom under the bed. The door was still open, so I looked outside and (this happened very fast) I noticed how dead still and quiet everything was. I felt that little charge of fear race up my spine and I remember that the hairs were standing up on my arms and neck, and at that moment my mother came back ! and started to shut the door, when all of a sudden we both heard this SCREAM. It was not human, it was not any animal I had ever heard. It was almost like a cross between a woman's scream and a cougar. Since I knew that there weren't any cougars or women standing out on our dock, we both knew we were hearing something unimaginable. We then heard big sloshes of water, as if something great was passing through the lakefront. (Our House was only about 1/2 an acre up from the lake.) This whole episode probably only lasted about 5 minutes. We then noticed that the normal sounds of the swamp came back as if someone had turned the lights back on.

When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn't see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can't believe what I saw, there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds.

We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time. As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed \"Human\" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this \"person\". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home. We walked for a couple hours, no way were we going back the way we came. Did not notice any smells or sounds. Just very quiet. No animal sound at all.",

I am thinking I just missed that squatch by a matter of minutes or hours! SO CLOSE! Well, let me tell you what!! These things were 12'' long and the stride between steps was measured at 8 feet! The line of prints was straight, just like you see with other evidence of a bigfoot trail! It was INSANE. There were no other prints around, I followed these about a quarter mile into the depths of the woods and off the beaten path. The snow was up past my knees at some points but how could I stop following this epic trail! I could see some prints more clearly than others, I could see toe outlines and the heel in a few! I have pictures and videos to share with you. By the looks of the size of the prints and the distance in stride, this seems like an adult sasquatch, These things were huge!! The sun was setting and my phone was dying so to my dismay I had to turn around and get back to the path before dark, otherwise I would have followed those tracks until they lead me to whatever made them, and we know what made those beasts!

      "OBSERVED": "Let me start out saying I grew up in the woods of northern Michigan(I was 18 at the time ) I have hunted trapped and fished just about every critter in those woods since I was a very small child and have never experienced any thing like this (that couldn’t be attributed to any thing conventional) before or since ! The night started out normal my ex and I departed for a night of coon hunting. We released the old black and tan hound about a mile from where the encounter happened on a large creek bottom of Fletcher creek just north of eight road where the creek crosses the road this was  around 9 o clock pm . The dog took off across the thick creek bottom headed west then north crossing an open meadow and some pine trees before striking the coons sent and quickly treeing the coon on the edge of a large swamp in a big white pine everything normal so far. we didn’t have a gun with us that night so we quickly loaded up the dog and took off to tree another. We released the dog again where the road  (possibly 5 or 5and a half road)intersects a old beaver pond where she promptly struck a scent and made a long arching track north then east then south east covering a few miles of the dense forest quickly. I soon realized the dog had struck a bear or bobcat track as she had chased and treed both (in the area and never chased trash deer coyote etc..) and was covering ground quickly in a circle so we decided to intercept the dog on the next trail by the time(around 10 thirty) we got ahead of the dog she had treed whatever she was chasing about a mile south of the road( I don’t know the name of it there is a hunting pen and an oil well on the end of it) so we set off unarmed with two lights nearly dead after about a half mile whatever she was chasing took off again this time easterly assuming it was a bobcat I shut the lights off and stood silently (a bobcat will jump tree and run if it sees a light coming) the dog promptly treed or/bayed the animal it was chasing again about a mile away we headed that way using the lights sparingly again the animal ran after repeating this another two or three times we finally closed the gap to about 300 yards when suddenly  the dog went silent and ran straight  to us (without calling she wouldn’t come if I called I never could call her off a trail EVER!) tail between its legs whimpering I thought this was odd because the dog had fought bear coon and bobcat and never backed down or lost I didn’t think much of it I was glad to have her back so we could go so I  just leashed the dog and started back out we were less than disorientated because of the long twisting turning chase and no moon and to make matters worse the lights died and we had no cell service! after about an hour of walking in what I thought was the right direction I began to hear something big trailing slightly behind and to the left me I stopped and asked my friend if she had heard any thing she admitted she had but didn’t want to admit it for fear of me picking on her  we continued and so did the trailing I kept throwing the dim dead light back in the direction of the animal each time the brush would crash and limbs high I don’t know how high but higher than a deer could reach and only a large bear on its hind legs could move or break would react to something fleeing the light before it would die out again after a couple seconds the dog continued its unusual behavior (tail between its legs and skittishness)especially when the animal began circling us we would hear it then it would be silent and a leaf would crunch a head of us I would shine the light in that direction and the sound of heavy pounding feat and big 3 inch around trees would break and shake then the light would go dead The whole time I felt as if something large and intelligent was observing us sizing us up the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and shivers ran down my spine the whole incident lasted an hour or 2 we never saw the animal but heard it circling us and breaking huge limbs trees 2 to 3 inches were being broken within fifty feet of us and less and we never saw the animal just the vegetation around it broken or moving after it fled our light for a brief moment before the light would die. It was almost as if it were deliberately breaking trees to intimidate us or that is what it felt like. I never looked for hair or tracks  there was a good foot of leaf cover so tracks were unlikely I never thought of it as a big foot just an unexplainable anomaly . I assumed it was a bear but there was no “woofing” or jaw “popping” both of which I have heard before and I don’t believe the dog would have backed down after treeing and chasing a few already I don’t know if this was a big foot or not it is near some of the other sightings on your web page (I had no idea there were big foot sightings in Michigan) so I figured I would share my story  I’m not a big foot believer I believe in the possibility but I’m still skeptical. The only other   strange occurrence I had occurred within about  a mile of the other 3 weeks or so earlier when the dog treed a young bear we left the tree to immediately hear a low cry like that of a juvenile animal a whaaa-ooo-a first in the distance then about fifty yards away we attributed it to the young bear calling for its mother and left reflecting on it later it was unlike any bear sound I’d heard -death cry roar growl nothing I don’t know  it was raining hard so perhaps the sound was distorted.",

I was on the northern side of the southernmost small peak, heading down to go back to my vehicle. I was heading through some trees when I looked to the north at the other hill. This hill comes up further out from the main mountain than the hill that I was on. The peak is therefore more west, and then heading east it slopes down, flattens out, then heads back up the main mountain. I was looking through these trees I was heading through up at the flattened part of that hill. I was looking right at this tree. I'd say it was a good ten feet tall. I'd say I was about 200-300 yards away from this tree. He must have seen me, because when he walked out from behind that tree, I could tell he was looking right at me. And something about the way he timed it tells me he wanted to scare me. I'd say he was about 8 feet tall, judging from the distance, and he walked just like the saquatch in the old video of him walking through that small clearing in the forest. You all know the one. Probably the most popular one out there. His arms swayed back and forth, hanging limply from his shoulders. He walked about 15 feet then disappeared behind another tree.

(Busick is so small that google earth does not have a marker for it.)   On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark.   Later, while we were sitting near the campfire playing dominos, we heard the same yell and heard rustling in the woods nearby.   We couldn't distinguish what it was because there were some people singing christian hymns at a small theatre nearby.   Later that night, when I was asleep, my friends(they were brothers) were talking about the upcoming wedding of one of them this coming spring and the younger brother says that he saw it move through the woods very close to our camp.   He told me about it the next day and I got kind of scared, since I may have seen a bigfoot in New Mexico back in 1994 while in the boy scouts.   The next day the two brothers went on a long hike and I stayed in camp since I was experiencing foot problems and had no hiking boots.    I got really bored so I decided to walk down what seemed to be a game trail into the woods for a few hundred yards.   I noticed that there were a lot of trees that were broken, like something had bended them.   None of these trees were very thick, but there were a few that I knew I could not snap.   I started to get a little scared, like something wasn't right.   I was only about a 1/4 mile from the campground, and I saw it.   It scared the s**t out of me.   I only saw it for about 10-15 seconds(maybe, I was so scared it could've been 5 seconds or it could have been a minute), and the best way to describe it would be that it looked like the bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons only it was heavier and a little bit darker.   I was probably about 15-30 feet from it when I saw it.   We stared at each other for the duration of my sighting, and then it walked away as if I wasn't anything to worry about.    I stood in that spot for a little while and then walked back to the campsite, stopping every now and then to look around for the thing.

He called me up to tell me what he saw.  It turns out that on Feb. 6th I was on my way home on the same road in the same location.  It was around 10:20 pm and I was doing about 50 mph.  I saw something run across the road extremely fast.  It was around the same height as the hood of my car and it was black in color.  It ran so fast I didn’t even need to hit the breaks.  Being an avid outdoors man I can usually identify animals, but I was not able to identify this one.  It was defiantly on two legs and covered in black hair.  No bear can run that fast and it defiantly wasn’t a coyote or fox.  I drove home as fast as I could; I was shocked by the encounter and called my friend to tell him.

      "OBSERVED": "My summer ecology class was hiking to Middle Fork Lake. As with most classes, some students walked faster than others. I was with the stragglers, a few of whom were suffering from the cold and thin air. The trail had only been opened, as I recall, the previous day, and ours was the first group of the season to make the ascent. Lots of snow remained in shaded areas and in many places on the trail, and it was obvious no one had walked ahead of us, although a couple of older men on four wheelers passed us at one point. We were getting fairly close, within a half mile or so, to the lake; the slope was very steep. I remember our little group went past a switchback and we were uphill from a stream. Somewhere in this stretch, crossing the trail at a right angle, was a series of very large, apparently bipedal, tracks. In shape and contour, the tracks appeared human. No details, such as toe impressions, remained or could be readily detected, but every indication was that the tracks had been made by bare feet, not boots. The students immediately starting exclaiming, “Bigfoot, bigfoot!” Doing my best to downplay the tracks, I told the students that they were probably those of a hiker and that they had become enlarged as a result of melting and refreezing. Privately, I didn’t believe that story for a second. As far as I was concerned, the impressions were the record of something extremely unusual. The tracks were huge, at least sixteen inches or more in length and quite wide. The depth of the tracks in the snow and soil was far beyond what I could duplicate; it was obvious, even to the students, that whatever or whoever made the tracks had immense weight (I told them the “hiker” was probably carrying a very heavy pack). The distance between the tracks was on the order of four feet or more, an interval that was all the more impressive considering the extreme steepness of the mountain in that area. It did not seem possible to me for any human to duplicate such a feat (so to speak) as was performed by the mysterious maker of those tracks, especially considering the conditions of snow and slope. In addition, the tracks were not headed to Middle Fork Lake. Of course, that doesn’t prove anything, but I found it strange that anyone would hike up the mountain, avoiding the trail, and heading to something besides the lake. As best as I could determine, the tracks appeared to be going in the direction of Bull-of-the-Woods Mountain.",

Literally before the question was completed, they started talking to each other in Spanish and then said, “Bigfoot?” They told me that an acquaintance of theirs, a fellow guide who they described as very experienced, had a sighting.

My wife opened the door and said that someone was standing outside the entry door to the bedroom of the trailer.  I went back to the room and saw a large shadow in the window.  The window is privacy glass so they couldn't see inside.  I could see a chest, a head and about half of the arm.   I reached into the night stand a took out my pistol thinking that it was someone.  I then started toward the back of the trailer to the main entry door.  While I was doing this my wife thought to take photos.  She took 3 photos which does show the shadow of whatever it was very well.  When I was at the other end of the trailer I opened the door and turned on the outside light at the same time.  There was nothing there, I did hear what sounded like someone walking very quickly in the distance.  I went around the trailer but couldn't see anyone.  It was at this time that I realized that the window on the door is too high for someone to have been standing there.  I took pictures to show how high it is.  We waited until daylight to go back outside, I looked around the front and side of the trailer and noticed what appeared to be large tracks in the gravel.  I took pictures of these.  My friend who is a photographer took a copy of the pictures showing the shadow in the window and enlarged them while trying to keep the clarity and it is possible to make out some of the features.

They turned to see a dark hairy creature, very muscular, standing with its back to them at the rivers edge.  The creature then pulled a cypress stump out of the mud and threw it into the river.  They froze and were dumb-struck.  They guessed it caught wind of them because it turned to look directly at them and then walked briskly away down the rivers edge.  They went to the spot where the creature was standing and saw large human like footprints, much larger than a mans print.  They were about 75 yards away from the creature. The discription of the creature was what I've written plus they said they could tell when it turned around that it had parts of the face with no hair around the nose and mouth area.  They stated it was between 6 to 7 feet tall and very heavy.  The thing that stood out to them was the fact that it pulled the stump from the mud.  They said it had to be very strong to do that. The father is a very stoic person.  I have met this family on several occasions since my stepbrother is so close to them.  The son of course was glad to verify the story, but the father didn't want to talk much about it other than to say \"I know what I saw.\"  The story did not waiver one bit from when my stepbrother told me and his friend told me several months later",

There was a car in front of me that started slowing down so i started to pass him and he look at me and i looked at him he must have seen it also by the looks he gave me and the way he shook his head.  so we went on to natchitoches and i started to pull over at the gas station and he followed me when we stopped he asked me if i saw it also i said yes he was from out of state missouri is what his licence plate said never got his name. We just said that neither of us has ever seen anything like that before.  I have seen bears  well a few of them anyway and that was no bear.  When i got home i told my parents what i had seen and they laughed at me at first but then saw i was serious.  you can ask them about it.  Have only told a few people about it since but travel that way often and can go to the exact spot and have showed it to friends that i have told about but have never got out and checked it out.

I was using fence staples to stake the traps to the roots of trees.  I had finished hammering in the staples on the last trap and was baiting the trap with the fish when I heard something walking towards me out in the woods.  I don't remember if I could tell if it was walking on two legs or not but I thought it was strange that any wild animal would approach me when I had just finished hammering staples.  I backed out into the powerline and stood by a power pole to see if whatever it was would come out of the woods but it would'nt.  It stayed back about 10 yards from the edge of the woods walking back and forth.  I had a small flashlight with me and I decided to try and shine whatever it was.  I pointed the light in the direction of the footsteps and turned it on.  I could'nt see anything because of the undergrowth but whatever it was started whooping and ran off.  I was also followed out of the woods after dark one night later that year by what must have been the same thing because when i shined my light in its direction it whooped and ran off just like before. I did'nt see anything that time either due to the undergrowth. I've lived in this area all my life and i've never heard anything make a noise like that.  I'm not saying this was a bigfoot.  I don't have any idea what it was. We have deer and coyotes in this area but i did'nt think either of these made whooping soonds.

      "OBSERVED": "Mr. E.H. stated to me that he was returning from work one afternoon when he came out of a curve in the road (gravel) traveling West and saw a creature he estimates to have been 6-7 feet in height and weighing over 300 lbs. cross the road approximately 3 telephone poles up from his position. The creature was traveling South to North. He stated that he was traveling about 30mph. Mr. E.H. also stated that the creature was brownish-red in color, no facial features were noted as the creature never looked in his direction.The head appeared to look like a humans. The creature crossed the road in about 3-4 steps, and was very fast. He said that the creature looked to be hunched over. The arms were swinging in a pumping like fashion, like a sprinters arms would pump. Mr. E.H. stopped at the area the creature crossed and looked around, no smell or odor was noted, and no tracks were found due to the hardness of the road and ground. Nothing else was noted. This is the second sighting. The 1st was in 1976 on a pipeline by Mr. E.H. and his wife. The creature in this sighting was also a brownish color and was seen crossing a pipeline.This is in the same area as the 2nd sighting. This area appears to be an active area. Unknown vocalizations also occur at this area. Mr. E.H. has lived and hunted in this area for 40+ yrs and has never heard the vocalizations being heard before. He lives approx. 5-7 miles into the woods. During my visit on 4-5-2000 (Wednesday) myself, Mr. E.H. and his son found a 12\" track near his home. We were on 4-wheelers traveling to an area near a previous sighting by a family member. We came to a large puddle in the 4-wheeler trail and were trying to negotiate around it when he asked me to come look at something. What I found was a 12\" track that was no more then a few days old. The track had some wear due to the rain from Sunday night through Monday late afternoon. We were approximately 1/2 - 3/4 of a mile into the woods. I sent his son to get my plaster box from the back of my truck as I had no where to carry it in. After looking around I found another track about 10 yards from the other but in a very wet and flooding area. I photographed this track as it was impossible to cast. No other tracks were found. After his son returned I measured the track and found it to be 12\" inches in length, and was 3/4 to 1 inch into the ground. Mr.E.H. tried to make a track in the ground nearby but was unsuccessful ( he weighes over 200Lbs). It was unclear how many toes were present due to the mud and leaves in the track. Several photos were made of the track before plaster was poured into it. Due to prior obligations I was forced to leave the cast till Friday 4-7 when I could return. Mr. E.H. and myself secured the area as best we could. I returned on Friday around 10:30 am with my brother Shane.The 2 of us along with Mr.E.H. returned to the spot to retrieve the track cast. We retrieved the cast with no problems. We looked around the area and found what appeared to be Pine saplings that had been bitten and picked at to retrieve termites that were in the trees. We found approx. 8 -10 of these ranging from 3ft to 7ft off the ground. We also found a tree about 3 inches in diameter that had been twisted at the base and broke over. Photos were taken of these. Due to rising water we were unable to go very far into the area to look further.",

      "OBSERVED": "Fall, October 1972, 7:00 am, out duck hunting in Lousiana bayous between Acadia Parish and Jefferson Davis Parish. Had been in the blind since 5:00 am, waiting for dawn. As there were no ducks landing in the pond we had chosen for our blind, my friend and I decided to do some exploring of the surrounding bayous and overflow into the cypress forest swamps. We were in a 14 foot flat bottom boat with a three horse power outboard motor. There was a low, misty fog (not thick) on the water, the sky was entering the dawn's twiligt as there was a reddish peach tint at the horizon and the sky was light (not yet daylight). As we were traveling on the water at a low speed to avoid cypress knees, stumps and floating debris, we noticed a large object directly in our path. It was about 30 yards in front of the boat. At first it appeared to be stationary, until we realized it was moving toward us. As we got closer, our first impression was that it was a man with long grayish brown hair and long beard (a lot of hair on face). We shouted out, thinking perhaps the person had capsized his boat, as we were in a wide channel of water. There was no reply from the \"person\". As we got closer, we realized that the it was moving with purpose toward us. As we were not able to identify the object as a person through verbal contact, we started questioning ourselves as to whether it was a deer, cow, horse, wolf, coyote, dog, nutria, goose, duck, etc. Nothing fit the visual profile or movement of the \"object\". It appeared to be walking through the water, not swimming. The gait matched that of a man up to his shoulders in water, walking. Shoulders swaying back and forth in a forward motion, not that of a large quadruped swimming and lunging or bobbing up and down as a horse, cow or deer would. I checked the water depth by plungeing a six foot paddle into the water and could barely touch bottom with my arm immersed up to my elbow (an extra 18 inches of length over the paddle). We started to become very scared and aggitated as we could not identify it visually and by this point were exceedingly close (approx 15 yards) and could already discern what apeared to be eye sockets, nose and mouth behind a long matted hair. At this point my friend wanted to shoot it with a 12ga shotgun, I stated that I would not shoot what I am not sure of and that if wounded the \"object\" could possibly lunge forward and capsize our boat. At ten yards, I turned the boat around abruptly and gunned the motor. We were both in a panic, and shouting with fear. We left the decoys in the water and went straight back to the boat landing. We were shaking with fear, yet both agreed not to tell any one for fear of being ridiculed and deep inside my self, to protect the \"animal\"! Neither of us wanted to start a \"witch hunt\" by crazed cajun hunters. I am coming forward now, as my memory of the incident has been resurfacing repeatedly in the last month.

Well I can tell you one thing, I was raised in the small town of Dry Prong La, as we spent many a night in the woods camping. Most of the time in the swamps around Little River. Well one night we were sitting in camp listening to the sounds of the night, and watching the ligntning bugs as they floated in the still air. When all of the sudden the woods came alive with screaming, not like any thing I ever heard in my life. I know what panthers, and wild boares sound like, but this was one sound i will never forget. We shined the flash lights out into the direction of the screaming, and what we saw or thought we saw was to say the least some what up setting. My grandfather and my Uncle were raised in this part of the woods, and i had never seen then afraid of any thing, but this was one time that was diffarent. We would have left right then and there, but it had rained earlier in the evening, and the road was to muddy to travel. We had to spend the night, oh and what a night it was. I can't  remember ever being so damn scared in my life. That thing tore the woods up all around us, and it screamed and made some of the wierdest noises i ever heard. I don't think i will ever forget that night, even as I write this, twenty years later, I can still hear it. Well any way, in the early morning hours it finally went deeper into the swamp and out of our area. We waited until first light and with gun in hand we decided to have a look at what ever was there. The small trees were broken about six feet off of the ground. Not totally off, just snapped and shoved down. The grass around them was flattend to the ground and we looked for some king of foot prints. What we found, no one would have ever believed us. They were huge! I have to tell you one thing, I had never heard of big foot or any other kind of wild animal at that time. But now I know what was there, and it was one night I will never forget.",

We decided to get out of the woods as quickly as we could. We all started running back up to the house. When we made it back into the yard we all felt pretty safe. Then I heard my sister say what is that? I looked, and standing at the edge of the woods in between two trees I saw this tall, black,thing. I guess it was at least seven foot tall. I could see its eyes, and its scalp was almost pointed. It just stood there and looked at us. The edge of the woods was probably about 300 yards from where we were standing, and I can remember it like it was yesterday. It stood there and looked at us untill we decided to go in the house.

It was standing in a bamboo thicket,motionless. I remember the wind was blowing around and I noticed the fur blowing around on its head. It had no expression,it made no noise. I was paralyzed with fear and couldnt move. It had to be on two feet because the bamboo we were in was way over my head. From going over this over and over in my head it was around 5-6 feet tall. But the main thing I remember was the stare. I didnt want to run because I did not know if it was going to charge like a dog or what. I slowly backed down into the ditch and climbed backwards up the other side. I was not going to turn my back on it. When I reached the edge of the woods I ran. I recall the color was a reddish brown.

One night my mother, my grandmother and I heard a loud bang on the back of house which shook the house. When we went to check it out, we saw a large figure pass by the dining room window. This window was rather high off the ground. I was about 10 or 11 at the time and I could not even reach the bottom of this window. But whatever it was covered the entired window from top to bottom and side to side as it passed over it. So it had to be tall and rather large. It was dark in color and appeared to be covered with hair. My grandmother got her gun and we spent most of that night without sleep. On another night, in the early fall, I was in bed with the window open above my bed. My mother was in the bathroom right next to my room in the shower with the window beside her also open. At the same time we heard something walking in the leaves in our yard just outside. She ran from the bathroom to my room. I had heard this thing walking and breaking sticks as it approached. I could also hear it breathing. I had the impression it was quite large from the sound of the breathing which was heavy. It made a slight deep moaning sound as it breathed. I was paralyzed with fear and I could not look out my window, I could not even get out of bed when my mother came to the door and yelled for me to come to her. She made herself come to my bed and grab me out of the bed but she also couldn't bring herself to look out the window. It made the hairs stand up on our necks and we just weren't able to try and look at it. We did not smell anything that night. We could not find footprints from either of these two incidents because of the yard being covered with leaves, however we did find broken sticks where it was apparent something rather heavy had walked in order to break them (we didn't weigh enough to break them, we tried). And we did find footprints on numerous occasions out behind our home down a dirt road that went not even a quarter mile to an oil well. We also discovered hairs on the barbed wire fence. We saved some of these and I believe my parents sent them off to be analyzed, but we never heard anything from it. The hair color did not match any animals in the field nearby. The animals in the field were cows and were black and red in color. This hair was a light brown. It was also about 4 or 5 inches long. This is going to sound a little far-fetched but during the time we lived here we witnessed what we believed was a young sasquatch become mature. It happened over a period of years. We first noticed rather large 4 toed footprints (I have no idea where the 5th toe was) on the dirt road behind the house. It was larger than any man's could be. It had 5 ft. spaces between prints. And one was so heavy that it inprinted in some soft rock in the area. We watched these footprints a lot. No one we showed them to could identify them. However, bear prints were ruled out by the people we showed them to. We saw them all the time there. There was a pond nearby that maybe it was using for water. One day we noticed a smaller set of prints along side the larger ones. We watched over time as these prints got larger and larger with the other ones. Then one day it was just the one set of smaller prints. Those got larger and larger until they reached what appeared to us as grown. Even up to the time we moved from there, we had incidents and saw these prints. We also saw where it looked like something had bedded down under a rotted out tree and had packed the ground with straw. There were tiny piles of bones and feathers there too, not strewn around but arranged neatly in piles. My grandmother heard something in those woods also while hunting that sent her running so fast she lost her footing and tumbled down the hill and skinned herself up. She could not describe the sound to us, she just kept saying it was not like any sound she had ever heard. She had been tracking a buck and listening to it snort in some dense brush when she heard it from the opposite direction. It only yelled once. But that was enough to scare her so badly to cause her to hurt herself getting away and she was in shock when she got back to the others she was hunting with and her face was so white they were afraid she was going to pass out. She won't talk about it now. I will tell one other incident, and quit on that. It happened to my sister (14 at the time), a friend of my sister (also 14 at the time) and myself (11 at the time). We had walked down the dirt road behind our house and had reached just inside the edge of the woods. We starting to smell this awful smell we could not identify. We were talking about this smell when suddenly we heard a grunting/growling noise from the woods beside us. It was not very loud but it was a deep sound that terrified us. We ran immeditely home and did not venture back there alone again. We were even scared when we would go down there with family. We all often walked that road. But we all always felt like we were being watched the whole time. These woods behind our house were connected with a large swampy wooded area called Middlefork Bottom. It was connected to the Kisatchie National Forest. I must also mention that on the occasions this thing visited close to our home, our 2 dogs we had would not bark, as a matter of fact they would leave our house for 3 days at a time and not return until we went to get them from a neighbor's house down the road. If we brought them back sooner than that, they would duck their tails behind them and run away again. I have never seen brave dogs that pitiful looking. Other people who lived nearby had incidents with footprints, sounds and smells as well.",

      "OBSERVED": "My brother-in-law and I decided to go hunting on the last weekend of hunting season. We went to our camping spot that we have gone to for over 20 years and set up camp. This was on Friday night. The next day was uneventful and we were both tired so we went to sleep about 8 PM. Sometime later in the evening, I awoke to very loud screaming and some sort of yelling that I have never heard before in all my years of being in the wilderness. The screaming lasted about 20 to 30 seconds, stopped for about 20 seconds, then started again. This happened 3 times. I finally got my brother-in-law to wake up and he heard about 4 or 5 seconds of the third time. We were both very tired and he fell back asleep in seconds. It was really quiet. You could not hear anything. I could not go back to sleep after that. I laid in my sleeping bag inside the tent for about 30 to 40 minutes with dead silence in the forest. When I was just starting to doze off again, I heard footsteps entering our camp. I heard the footsteps, which were not of a 4 legged animal, walk past my side of the tent. It walked around the entire tent and I saw a shadow on the end of the tent about 5 feet high. With the moon being up in the sky, whatever cast the shadow had to have been taller than 5 feet. It circled the tent and walked by my side again. It stopped at the other end of the tent and scratched the material like it was trying to figure out what the material was. It walked away from the tent after that and went across the gravel road. I could hear the gravel under its feet. After it crossed the road, it went into the woods. After a minute or so, I heard the sound of 2 sticks hitting together about 15 to 20 times. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night. The next morning, we got up and I told my brother-in-law what else had happened during the night. We looked for tracks around the tent, but the ground was covered with a thick layer of leaves and pine needles. We looked on the road , but the road bed is red clay based and very hard. We packed our gear and headed for home. As we drove home, my brother-in-law said it sounded like 2 voices screaming to him, which I had thought about and not mentioned to him, so I know he was awake enough to realize just what he was hearing.",

I heard a woodknock close by then a chest beat and a bluff charge through the brush. Then a tree push down. I yell roared \"I want my Dog!\" and beat hard against the tree.

We had ridden a 4-wheeler to a deerstand not far from the house. We had been there about 30 minutes. It was near 4 pm and the sun was just beginning to go down. It was almost dusk. We were out there hunting for deer when I told my friend K.H. that there was something moving closer to a group of wild hogs about 40 feet from us.When it got closer we saw what appeared to be a man \"duck walking\" towards the hogs. It scratched it's head and looked around and began to shuffle one foot back and forth (as if it was shifting its weight) .It was also making \"blowing sounds like a deer does\". I shifted my position in the deerstand and hit my shotgun ( 20ga.) against the inside of the deerstand and it heard it and stood up.  The hogs ran off when it stood upright. We bolted out the back door of the stand and jumped on the 4 wheeler and hauled it out of there,after turning a corner and across a small creek I (L.C.) looked back and saw it standing by a tree watching us leave. We had watched it all total for about 10 minutes. It was reddish brown, covered with hair and we could see it's eyes . The face was somewhat covered with hair but not as covered as the rest of the body. It was about 7 feet tall and maybe 300, to 350 pounds.",

I had been asleep when i was awaken by the sounds of the raccoons in the garbage cans as they often did.Being a kid it was fun as well as fasinating to wtach them play so i decided to stay up an watch them,everyone else was still sleeping. I dont know how long i watched but i noticed they kept looking towards the woods.The woods were separated from our camp by a narrow (4'-5' across) but deep stream (5-6' deep) .When all of a sudden i heard a loud splash,the sound like wading (im getting chills writting this) .it was at this point that i noticed that all the raccoons were gone. I crouched down barely looking over the window edge so as not to let what was coming across the creek see me watching. As it rose out of the creek it let out a very deep growl then made some grunting sounds as it climbed the embankment as it did this i heard another splash as another entered the water. i watched as the 1st creature climbed out of the creek area and into sight (we kept 2 lanterns on during the night for security reasons) as i saw this creature go thru our things that were left out,i began to cry from fear. In front of me was a creature that was at least 7' tall and very big,it was covered in hair. I watched it as the 2nd came out of the creek making almost the same growl and grunting sounds as the 1st had done. I laid back down not wanting to see them look my way and come to where i was.

At that time I though who is in my yard (as we had 6 acres of woods that backed up to rogully swamp and flaggon was near by).  So I got up and went to  the back door and stepped out to see who was out there. What I saw was something big and black that stepped over the 4 1/2 chain link fence and walked into the woods.  I did not know what I was looking at, but we lived rurally and our house set about an acre off the road.  Being in the late 70's the area was not developed.  So I could not imagine it being a person.  When I told my dad about it, he told me it was nothing and not to worry about it.  So for years I put it out of my mind.

      "OBSERVED": "This was in the early 80s,late spring early summer. i was still in High school ( Graduated in 1983)  Myself my two brothers and my best friend and his two brothers were in a field with our dogs goofing off,on top of a hill over looking a swamp bottom.We had been talking about and wondering why the cattle that stayed in this field never went to certain part of the field.( the area we were looking at).(We jokingly called this the Devils corner because of this).On this particular day the cattle had wandered into this area and were grazing. After about 10-15 mins of us sitting at the top of the hill talking about this we noticed that a few of the cattle looked very anxious and were looking toward the fence row that bordered the swamp area. We all started getting excited that the cows were scared of something, when all of a sudden the herd startled and began running up the hill out of that corner and bottom. Since we were in their path we moved and watched them run back to ward the south end of the field. Being curious we gathered up some weapons (logs,sticks,rocks) and decided to go see what was there, not expecting to see anything. We crossed the bottom and started toward the fence row.We noticed that it was extremely quiet in that corner of the field . We began to look around when we noticed some reddish hair stuck to the barbs on the fence.Then thought hey there are no reddish colored cows,so why is this hair this color and on the top row of 4 row barb wire fence ( fence was 5 ft at the highest point) we then heard something moving in the woods (very thick and dense,lots of thorns)where the hair was at. At this time i noticed that a pine tree roughly 5inches in diameter had been twisted and knocked over about 8-10 feet up.We hadnt had any storms recently and no other trees were damaged. We decided we should leave.As we started to leave my the younger boys threw there stuff down and began running me ,but me and my friend didnt. I then had the feeling that we were being watched,i asked my friend if he felt that as well and he said yeah, i turned toward the fence to see a face about 7ft up standind next to the broken tree,i asked my friend if he saw it as well and said uh huh, we stared at it for about 2 mins before we ran away. What i saw was 2 eyes a gray/white color with reddess hair,the top of the head was hiddien by brush,the bridge of the nose was very apparent,straight,long and narrow the rest was hidden from view. After that we never said anything about it again.About a month later my friend decided he was going back in there to look around with his dog.(this is the same dog that was with us the first time and acted very afraid,and this dog has chased many animal in that field) I wnet to the fence row by the broken tree with him but told him i was not going in there with him and that id wait there for him.He said he'd be back later.After he crossed the fence i lost sight of him about 5ft in. No sooner had i lost sight of him i hear movement to the left of the spot he went in, shortly after this i heard him come running back to the fence row, he was yelling i saw it, i saw it..he jumped that barbed wire fence in stride with his dog hot on his heels. From that day on we never went to that area again. Later on that fall we had found a calf in the swamp that had been ripped open and the guts had been pulled out,but not eaten.We passed it off as wild dogs or coyotes/wolves. Later that winter we had a snow (unusual) and again found another calf that was the same way but in another area of the field. We also passed this off as wild dogs, coyotes/wolves. But since reading about the deer kills in other states,i began to think that these calves had been done the same way.We never talked to anybody about what we saw.Except the calves. That wooded area has since been cleared/thinned and but the swamp is still there.This swamp has access to Bayou Marie,Cedar lake ,and the Red River.My parents still live there so i visit the area every month.",

I believe that throughout the course of my life, (I'm 27 now), I have encountered this \"bigfoot\" twice, possibly three times in three different states. My second encounter was when I also lived in Pineville, La! In a log cabin on the Donahue Ferry road to be exact. It was 1985 watching TV show  of Haleys comet. It was fairly late ( I was eleven and it was way past my bedtime) in the evening. There was almost no moon as I stood out in the back yard looking up at the sky to see the comet. The house had a large yard bordered by a pine forest on two sides. As I looked up at the sky I was startled to death by an EXTREMELY loud scream that came from the very edge of the forest aboout 100 feet away. I immediately started running back up a small hill toward my house when the high pitched scream blasted my ear drums again. The whole time I was running toward the house (75 feet away), I kept my eyes focused on the origination of the sound coming from the forest edge. While running, I slipped and lost my balance a little (as a result of not watching where I was going). When I did this, it seemed to startle what I could now see as a very large upright creature standing in the shadows. It had been there the whole time, I just didn't see it because it hadn't moved until I slipped. Its head came to the bottom branches of the trees that it was standing next to. I ran inside and told my father who dismissed it as a screech owl from the comfort of his lazy boy. I honestly don't know how he DIDN'T hear the scream. The next day I went out to the tree and, with some scrap wood, climbed up it and sat in the branch that was closest to its head. I remember sitting there with my legs dangling thinking that it was too high for me to just jump straight down.",

      "OBSERVED": "Encounters told to me by Logger Earl Whitstine. Sighting one occurred on Tuesday August 22, 2000 around 1300hrs.  Mr. Whitstine stated he was operating his cutter, which resembles a skidder in that the only difference basically is one has huge shear type cutters and the other has a holder.  Whitstine was approaching some fallen trees when he saw what appeared at the time to be the rear end of a horse.  Thinking this was a nearby resident's horse, he rattled the cutters in an attempt to scare it away, but as he rattled the cutters the object turned and stood up.  It was at this time he realized that he was not looking at a horse but a large bipedal creature.  He noticed that it was covered from head to toe in thick, long, jet black hair.  The hair around the face was also long and he couldn't make out any facial features.  The creature turned and began to head for a nearby logging road that ran parallel to Flaggon creek.  Whitstine then began to follow in the cutter, and as he got nearer to the creature it turned and jumped into the creek (bayou) and began to try to swim to the other side.  Whitstine stated it looked like it couldn't swim very well as it \"kept bobbing up and down trying to keep its head out of the water, but would occasionally go underwater.\"  After reaching the other side, the creature stopped and looked back then fled into the adjoining woods.  Whitstine called his boss who thought he was joking and brushed it off.  Whitstine also told fellow loggers who also poked fun at him.  Whitstine stated that he got as close as maybe twenty feet. Encounter number two occurred on Thursday August 24, 2000 around 0700-0730hrs while surveying a property line with another logger.  As they walked the line they came upon the creature again alongside a drying bayou (Boggy Bayou).  They came within eighty feet (measured during the investigation) of the creature as it stood looking at them from beside a large bush.  He yelled out to it \"Hey, what are you doing?\"  The creature then fled north away from Whitstine and the other logger.  Whitstine then called his boss and the property owner.  The land owner notified Wildlife and Fisheries, the Rapides Parish Sheriffs Office, along with the local paper and tv station.  The paper had the owner contact the BFRO.",

Two friends of mine and I decided one day to explore the woods off of a highway known as Texas Highway.  I remember we were deep in the woods and we came up on a stream, quite large, about eight feet in width. From the side of which we approached the stream we were about five feet above the water and as we approached the stream the three of us immediately spotted two Creatures on the other side of the stream in a crouching posture position drinking water from the stream.  We froze in amazement of what we were looking at, and at the same time the three of us were trembling with fear knowing we were so deep in the woods and quite lost.  We were looking at two Human/Ape like figures whom were completely covered with darkish brown gray hair but the face appeared to be of lighter tone skin. From the head down the two creatures had long hair past their shoulders,with alot of long grayish hair tones, the rest of the body was short hair. They were starring at us and we were starring at them..One was of adult and we could tell it was female and the other was childlike and was of male gender in appearance. They appeared to be just as frightened as we were and after about 30 seconds of this encounter the adult creature turned to the childlike creature and made a motion with it's hand and they turned around from the stream and started running through the woods. There was never a sound made from either one that we could hear. Needless to say when they took off running we did the same in the opposite direction and didn't stop until we were out of the woods. At that time we never spoke about the incident to an adult because we were not supposed to be off on our own exploring in the woods.",

My family and I was living in the town called Lake Charles which was across from West lake that was a industrial area Which led into small towns that was heavily wooded. It was the middle of September A muggy type of day. We lived in a place called Booker T. Washington courts. My mother, sister and I was waiting for my father to return from work late one afternoon. After a couple of hours we became concern I remember my mother being worried. By that time it turned dark and I remembered my mother said that it was 9pm. Finally my father walks thru the door but not empty handed. My father was a avid fisherman and thought that he would surprise his girls with fresh fish. I remembered the wonderful smell that came from that kitchen that night. It got hot so my mother opened the back door. That is when my sister and I had a chance to play, You see we would take turns pushing each other so that we could taking a ride on the screen door. It was a starry night I remembered looking up to take a view of the sky. So I decided to climb up on to the door to take a ride and I looked out to my backyard area where every one would park there cars, and the trash cans would be lineup in a row on the curve in front of cars. About 47-50ft away there was a tree also and remembered it because the leaves would never fall. The light pole was sitting under the tree with it’s bright light that would shine and light up that entire area. Than suddenly I seen what I thought was Tony the tiger walk up to the metal trash can rip the lid off and  savagely dig through the can looking for something. It was a beautiful sight to look upon this 7 1/2ft short red haired, muscular being. My sister and I look at it for about 20 minutes.  I was so happy that Tony had came to visit. but why did he not even turn his head to look at my sister and I. So we continued to look at it what I remember the most was the beautiful red rusty looking hair and its tan face. I only heard the rustling of the garbage the most striking thing that I remember was how long his arm were from the wrist to the hand area the fingers where long that when he was digging in trash he did not have to bent completely over to reach the bottom of the can. So I turned to my mother and said \"Mommy tony the tiger is digging in the trash can. My mother walked up to the door looked out and told us to quickly get away from the door and closed it in a hurry and locked it. It was never mention to my father who was in the next room. The next day we were allowed to go out to play I immediately went to investigate and their was trash thrown all over the place up to 10ft or so. The metal trash can lid was bent also and I though to my self why would Tony do this? This incident has never been discussed and being 5 years old at the time I didn’t think that anyone would believe their was such a thing.",

Paw Paw and my uncle were headed into the duck blinds at sunrise. The weather was cool and the steam was coming off the water. After climbing over a pasture fence with a kerosene lamp, they saw two red, round reflections in the tree line ahead of them. They stopped in their tracks as the \"lights\" came closer to them attracted to the light. Paw Paw said that he and his brother were frozen in fear and couldn't move. I don't know what the french name they used for it, but as it came closer it was a lumbering, furry figure, with red eyes reflecting in the light. When it came within a few feet, my uncle panicked and slapped my grandfather and they dropped everything they had with them and ran like hell all the way back home.

I was standing about 25 yards from the thicket and I could make out the outline of something standing in the brush. It was about 7 feet tall or more and very large.

As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it's a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more. Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.  It was about 6, maybe 6 and a half feet tall, had long brown hair all over it's body, and was stock still.  I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn't.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.

      "OBSERVED": "On this day, myself, a friend, Eddy and 2 girls, felt like taking a ride. Before I begin I just want it noted that there was NO drinking or the use of drugs. We decided to go to Plum Island. At the time, the refuge was free to enter and the entire road was dirt. That day there was no one in the refuge, as we drove down the road,  I noticed no cars the entire 6.3 miles of the refuge, it was empty, we drove to the end.  At the last small area to park, I pulled in, across the road was a narrow boardwalk that lead to a 50 foot observation tower. We all went up. We hung around up there for about a half hour, I started hearing noises, first I heard clicking, loud clicking, then short high pitched screams, it sounded maybe 100 yards away. I took a look around, but didn’t see anything.  I noticed there was no one in the area.  I saw no birds or waterfowl.  The sounds went on for about 10 minutes or so, I felt uneasy at this point and said we should go. We all got in my car and started back out. I was only driving for a couple of minutes and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road from the marsh/brush area on the left to the right, which had heavy brush and that lead to the beach.  I immediately looked at Eddy and asked “did you see that?”  He answered “Yes!” We asked each other what it was. The girls in the back seat didn’t see anything s they were to busy talking to each other. I slowed to almost a stop where what we saw it cross the road, there was solid brush that it went into, we could see where something went through the brush. There was no sign of  it, it was gone. The figure that crossed was huge, 7 feet or more, very wide, all black from head to toe. It was a little hunched forward as it walked upright. I noticed its arms were longer than average and they swung as it walked.  It took only three steps to cross the road. The road is about three cars wide. It had a smooth stride. It did not look in my direction,  just crossed the road and it was gone. I only saw it for about 5 seconds I could never forget the image of it crossing the road. I went back there today, my children wanted to see where I had the sighting.  I didn’t make back up the observation tower because of these flies that nest in the marsh, they are Green Headed Flies, they are, as the woman in the office said, “man eaters”.  They bite hard. As you drive down the road, they follow the car, dozens fly around the car. So the kids didn’t want to get out and get eaten by them and neither did I, so I didn’t get up on the observation tower to take a look. I have told a few people what I saw and they think I’m nuts.  My father looks at me strange because he knows I don’t make up stories like this, I don’t lie, so he just looks at me when I talk about it to him. I know what I saw, and I saw what I saw.",

We were the last house in the neighborhood, behind us was woods that ran for a mile or more in each direction.  One snowy Saturday I was home alone watching television.  My parents worked frequently and even though I was only 11-12 years old I was at home alone alot.  I was watching TV in our den which was situated between 2 windows.  It was around noon and overcast. My dog frequently barked whenever a car drove up.  When she started barking this time, I turned my head down our hallway to yell at her to shut up.  Looking back to the TV, I was startled to see a face peering through my window.  To the best of my memory, the face was fury, whatever it was it only around 5-6 feet tall.  I screamed and it made some kind of grunting noise.  It immediately took off around the back of the house, running on two legs, and through an open breeze way to the front and into the woods. To say I was frightened was an understatement.  I immediately called some friends who came over to calm me down. After thinking about it for a while I thought it could have been one of my friends wearing a mask and playing a joke on me. That theory ended when we went outside to see what the creatures footprints looked like, we were shocked to see hoofed footprints.  I never saw any sign of this creature again, but after reading what the men in Mashpee saw 2-3 years later, it sounds like Cape Cod might have a Bigfoot of some kind.",

      "OBSERVED": "In the Summer of 1970, I was taking my pony and dog for a walk in the thickly wooded area where my parents had just built a new house. It was at that time a very isolated area.  We had apparently disturbed the wildlife in the area as we were always seeing very large black snakes and other wildlife near the house.  I was not prepared, however, for the creature I encountered in the woods behind our home.  I looked up on the thickly wooded hill and saw a huge creature that resembled a gorilla or a bear.  It was dark in color and appeared to be hairy.  It was on the other side of an old fence from me.  I was very frightened. I fled the area immediately.  I wish I could describe this creature better.  I really don't think it was a bear.  Bears are not usually sighted in our area and this creature was really big and it startled me because of it's size.  I don't frighten easily and was accustomed to living in the country with wild animals.  The one thing that does amaze m e when I look back on this incident is that my dog and  pony had no reaction to this creature.  It makes me wonder if they had become accustomed to it coming around when we weren't outside.  I never saw it again but a couple of years later my mother saw something from her kitchen window that looked to her somewhat like a bear but she wasn't sure as she was not close enough to it to see features.  It was on all fours and it got into the nearby stream and walked around the bend and out of sight.  The area where we had these sightings was in Washington Co. MD.  We live near a stream and a thickly wooded area.  The stream feeds into the Conococheague Creek which then feeds into the Potomac River a few miles from our home.  My parents have lived there for 30 years now and there have been no sightings of any creatures such as the ones we observed in the early 1970's.  However, we were the first to really disturb that woods and the area is now much more developed.",

The area is very hilly but not mountainous even though there are mountains about 10 miles west of the area near Clear Spring, MD.  One strange thing about this area is that it is where a line runs that divides the limestone ground from shale ground and it is right on our property and just a maybe 150 feet from the sighting.  The shale ground was covered with cedar trees while the limestone ground is covered by Oak and Sycamores for the most part.  The area is near Cedar Ridge Road and along that road there are lots of huge limestones that are visible in the fields and many big sinkholes.  There have been stories that these sinkholes are above caves that run from the Potomac River back under this area.  The Potomac River is close to the area and the Conococheague Creek feeds into the Potoma c at Williamsport, MD which is about 4 miles from the sighting.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was on my way to work on a Saturday morning about 7 a.m.  It was a misty, foggy morning and I headed west on Rt 198 entering a elongated (approx. 1 mile) entrance ramp to Southbound I-95.  I had my lights on my small toyota and my windshield washers were on at intermittent speed.  I witnessed what I thought was a man come up from a steep ravine, walk over to the ramp guardrail and step over it in angular fashion.  I thought here comes someone looking to hitchhike this morning.  The \"man\" was tall and his appearance was a drab kind of mushroom color from head to foot.  I thought he was wearing smoked of rain parka or slicker because there wasn't a clear indentation from his head to the top of his shoulders.  As I got closer I realized that this \"suit\" was not material but looked like long wet matted fur/hair/yuck.   The \"man\" proceeded to step into the roadway.  I thought what is this jerk doing trying to commit suicide with my help.  He got several feet into the lane when he turned to face my oncoming car.  He stood there looking perplexed and actually swayed side to side several times as though he didn't know what was coming at him....my car.  All of sudden he startled and turned and ran back to the guardrail.  He bolted over the guard rail and went scurrying down the embankment.  My mouth was agape and I thought \"what in the hell was that!!!\" I was frightened and was too scared to even look over my shoulder or even into the rear view mirror. When I got to work that morning in Silver Spring, Maryland, I was shaking like a leaf.  My co-workers immediately noticed that I was upset.  I called the Laurel police to inquire if there had been any reports of an escaped gorilla in the area.  They thought I was kidding.  I called my fiancee and told him.  Years later there was an article in our local county paper about a man who was writing a book on big foot sightings in the area.  His article spoke of a sighting by two employees of a water treatment plant that was located within 150 yards of my sighting and this sighting had occurred in the Spring of 1976 just like mine.  Also his article said a scientist working at N.A.S.A. had also witnessed a big foot sighting in the same area as he headed for work in Greenbelt, Maryland.  I almost started to cry, all these years and what I had seen had stayed with me was finally being \"vindicated\".  I called the author of the article and related my story to him.  Several days later, though, I got a strange phone call.  The person on the end of the line was a male voice that asked me what the \"frequency was\".  I told him I didn't know what he as talking about, but he was very persistent that I knew the \"frequency\"  I felt that this call was somehow related to the call I had had with the writer of the article several days earlier...maybe coincidence but still I wondered.",

      "OBSERVED": "My friend and I had been searching for a place called Dickerson quarry in Dickerson Md, and had just located it on a map. We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry, it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry, we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped, whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry, hearing the strange sound several more times, always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though, being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind \"Did you throw something in?\". He said no, he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think, we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big, that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening, I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind \"What the hell is going on?\" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail, neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that, but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes, Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. At the time, I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot, but it sounds like a classic case. Ive only been back a few times since then and only in the winter where I can see for 100 yards!!",

      "OBSERVED": "First of all this is the first time I have ever come forward in writing about this incident(s) that took place approximately 18-19 years ago. Myself, my Uncle and a few hunting buddies frequented a 68 acre parcel of land in Street, MD.  One day we were conducting target practice (sighting in our guns) for the upcoming hunting season.  It was a warm, sunny day and off in the distance one of us noticed movement in a wooded area across Broad Creek.  It appeared that there was a large dark silhouette walking back and forth in the foliage.  Every time it walked back and forth it would stop and grab a hold of a large tree and began to shake it.  Keep in mind this was a calm warm day and no other trees were moving because there was no wind.  I thought it was very unusual behavior and must have taken an enormous amount of strength to be able to shake a tree of this size.  I peered through my 4 X rifle scope to examine the object more closely and observed it to walk upright and was covered with dark brownish hair.  Its head was large and I could only observe the upper half of the body.  When it turned, its arms appeared to be long and muscular and I could see that its back was very muscular too and had a \"V\" shape to it, which led me to believe that this was no bear.  It seemed to be agitated that we were there.  After about 15-20 minutes of watching it we decided to leave and never spoke of the incident again. Additional things: In October just after dusk that same year on the same parcel of property my uncle was walking from the the dirt road area through a grassy area down a hill to the barn.  I heard him yell and call out to me.  I came running thinking he had fell down and I observed him on the ground with his tools scattered all over the ground.  I smelled a horrible pungent odor, heard heavy breathing and large foot steps coming from the near by wooded area.  It was dark and I could not see anything and I got an eerie feeling of being watched.  I got my uncle up off the ground and he told me as he was walking down the grassy trail, he heard long loud foot steps coming up from behind him. Thinking it was one of us playing a prank on him, he braced himself for one of us to jump on his back, however whatever hit him from behind knocked him with such force, he feel forward to the ground causing him to drop his tool box.  He said whatever hit him ran into the woods and was grunting and walking back and forth.  We both got flash lights and tried to look in the wooded area where we heard the heavy breathing but did not see anything but heard what sounded like bipedal footsteps go down the large decline and cross the creek at the bottom. I am a trained observer and can only tell you what I saw.",

      "OBSERVED": "here in maryland theres not a lot to do. mostly me and my friends just hang out. the local cops dont like this and neither do the business owners. so alot of times we end up in parks or \"parking\" spots. on this night 8 people were gathered at this location in 4 cars. we all met up in town around 8-9 in the evening. thew cops decided too many people were gathering and chased us off. one local drinking or partying spot is nicknamed the \"lodges\". basically its gunpowder state park. a well known local fishing hole, the subject to indian related ghost stories and a middle of nowhere spot in the middle of civilization. we decided to head there. we arrived around 10. we proceeded on the usual chatting of whos car is faster, whos dating who and such. some people were using drugs. one or two had been drinking. me, my friend tom  and jason were not on this night. we all sat pretty quietly in our cars. nobody had been out accept for the occasional rearranging of seating for close to 4 hours. i do remember that it was very cold that night for our area. probably around 40 degrees? and it was definetly before halloween, since we werre making plans. three cars were facing forwards. my 87 mustang toms 68 mustang and brians dodge omni. the other ones were not. we were all parked side by side in a row facing a almost 45 degree grade of dense shrubs and 15- 30 foot tall trees. the road (bottom rd.) was in front and the bend in the stream was behind us with boulders and shrubs all around.lighting wasnt the best, but enough to make out the trees close to 50 feet away and ground cover around them.the area is almost indescribable. i could draw it for you or get a picture possibly. what happened was around 2-3 o clock we all stop talking to the noise of what sounded like someone running through the woods. i figued it was a deer. then you hear it crashing down the hill in front of us. this sounded like someone taking a running step down the side of a steep, loose gravel hill, breaking off limbs and whtever else they could grab to help slow them down. then- plop- out onto the road lands this human figure. i was looking down at this point. in the car next to me tommy goes \"jesus christ\" and i look up to see a dark huge figure hunch over to look back at us. instinctlively brian in the omni and i pull on our headlights almost at the same time. it was still a little hazy from the stream behind us and all i personally could make out by the time my eyes refocused was what looked like a humanoid figure, close to 8 foot tall, sprinting away from us. i can still destinctly remember the sound of it running away, exactly like someone running barefoot on blacktop or concrete. a slapping noise. i unfroze and got out. so did tommy and brian.we walked up the road a little and i felt really weird. at this point the last word spoken was tommys jesus christ. we all got into our cars. we sat there for about 10 minutes. then simultaneously we turned to each other and said \"its getting late\" or \" im too tired for this\" and decided to all head out. NOBODY spoke about this to each other for almost a year. some people that were there still wont talk about it willingly or in front of others. honestly i thought it was a gag at first. theres also alot of indian ghost stories tied to the area because of an indian graveyard. i dont know what it was. i dont care. all i know is that was not a man. and it sure as hell was not a deer.if you guys can explain it any other way for me thats fine. but i have at least 6 other witnesses i can get ahold of for you. alot of time has passed since this happened and alot of construction has happened also. so if it was what you are looking for its long gone now.but after the fact i have heard of a few other sightings like this, including a set of footprints less than 5 miles south of the area and within a year of our encounter.the area is bottom rd. and laurelbrook rd in fallston md. harford co / baltimore co  just inside the boundaries of the gunpowder state park.",

      "LOCATION_DETAILS": "General Location: A government operated wildlife research station in a major river drainage which empties into the Chesapeake Bay. The **** was established as a wildlife research refuge in 1936. Prior to 1936, it was a large privately owned family estate (since the 18th century) and partially owned by the defense department in the early 20th century. The refuge area has largely been left untouched and never encroached by development, large scale farming, logging, or citizens. Farming was limited during the 18th century as the family line became very wealthy and used the massive area as a private estate for family members from the 19th century onward. Specific Location: Central Tract (extremely secured, gated and guarded area that is off limits to all citizens that are not employees) This area has been dedicated to bacterial, viral, pesticide, endangered species, natural resources, and migratory bird research for over 50 years. This tract is nationally famous from Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\" book and the research which uncovered and revealed the extreme dangers of DDT and other pesticides. There are many old small research buildings trickled throughout the center portion of the tract. Surrounding the core of research buildings there are lots of very rare trees (true Chestnut trees, next to genetically modified Chestnut trees) and endangered plants. Beyond this core to the east are many mitigation research ponds and closed areas which breed endangered birds. The majority of the central tract is dense forests, streams, rivers and ponds.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was camping on the largest of the river islands on the ******** River in the extra restricted area of the ****'s Central Tract. It is an old growth forest. The understory was mostly clear of bushes and brush. I would from time to time camp out overnight there. I always camp with nothing more then a sleeping bag on the ground. While on the refuge I would not light fires, not cook food, not play music; just pure silence, meditation and observation. Late on this one evening in late July, I heard wood knocking or clapping in the distance from the south portion of the river. I instantly thought of Bigfoot (I must be honest, especially after all the activity I had observed throughout the months prior). I had a large stick with me, so I slapped it against an old tree. At first I heard no reply. I repeated the banging once every few minutes until I did got a response of knocking back. This was in the same location as before. It then returned to silence until about 15 minutes later when another knocking occurred. About an hour after the wood knocking I heard definite bi-pedal footsteps walking very slowly. The footsteps were obviously coming from something which was being very cautious. The creature was approaching from the south where the wood knocking sounds were coming from. I assumed that it was on the next island downstream (which is separated by a narrow deep channel of water 15 ft across by 6-10 ft deep). I remained silent the whole time as to not scare it off. The next thing I heard was a loud \"kerplunk\" of something falling or dropping into the water channel. Around 15 minutes later I heard a few faint footsteps walking away back to the south (these steps were not as gentle or cautious as before). It sounded as if it were tired of the game or just leaving because it investigated what I was doing. The rest of the night was silent. Following morning: The next morning I went over to the next island at the break of dawn. I found no obvious footprints or evidence. However, I did find possible large prints but they were not overly revealing.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "I have one major noteworthy aspect that I feel may be of importance. Before writing this report I did not of even think this was important, but now I do see a correlation. Earlier that same day, in the early morning (at dawn, this is when I started my work everyday), I began for the first time, data collecting on the island which the sounds came from. As I was collecting data on the edge of this very channel between the islands, the loose muddy bank gave way beneath my weight and I fell loudly into the water. I dropped my Geo XT GPS/CPU unit as I hit the water. (Luckily, it was waterproof) As I went under I finally could touch the bottom and push off. The water was about 7 ft deep. Before thinking, I dove back under to retrieve my GPS unit which was day glow yellow (thankfully). Then I struggled for about 2 or 3 minutes grabbing roots and anything to help me climb out. Once I got back up on solid land, I laid there for a minute catching my breath. I was covered head to toe with mud. I started laughing aloud and talking to myself, as I must admit, it was funny. I gathered all my equipment that had remained on dry land and carried everything down to the wide open rock covered beach on the large moving portion of the river. Being as there was no one else out there, I removed all my clothes and washed them off piece by piece in the river. I laid all my clothes out on large rocks to dry under the bright sunlight. I did keep my underwear on however, but nothing else. While my clothes were drying I sat on a large boulder and ate my lunch. I put my clothes back on later even though they were still damp. I remember later that day returning to the office and telling my story. Everyone kept commenting with humor that I smelled like the river and earth. At that time I figured silently to myself, \"what the hell I should just stay the night out there, being my scents were completely gone and I smelled as pure earth.\" So I returned back out there around 5pm after everyone left for the day and my evening story began.",
      "OTHER_WITNESSES": "Just me.",
      "OTHER_STORIES": "Yes, there are many incidents in this direct area. Most of the accounts are within a 5-10 mile radius. These accounts seemed to have started in the 1970's when regional mass development began outside of DC and north towards Baltimore along the I-295/I-95 corridors. I will list some of the accounts which I am familiar with: 1. During the 1990s a man driving home from work very early in the AM, spotted a dark bigfoot like creature hunched on the side of route 198 just off of I-95. As he drove past it stood up and ran off along the road jumping the guard rail. 2. During the early 2000s, a lot of sightings of a large brownish black creature along the ******** River from I-95 downward into the ****. Government biologists from **** investigated and confirmed it was a black bear. However, many observers said it was bipedal and not on all fours. Many locals around the **** claimed whatever it was took \"refuge\" in the ****. 3. Sightings during the building of Arundel Mills Mall in 1999, reported a large dark haired creature on the construction site. This report can be found on many sites and newspapers. This location is 10 miles north. 4. On my first day on the job at the ****, I met with my direct manager, a senior staff member, and he said to me (his exact words), \"We do not discuss Bigfoot around here. Got it?\" (I realized instantly he was covering some thing up). He then said, \"We have a citizen in the area that from time to time sends us audio recordings and \"evidence\" that a Bigfoot lives on the ****. He often puts in for permits to come in and investigate. Never speak to him if you see him around the visitor areas.\" 5. During my first driving tour through the refuge, a biologist from **** made the following statements to me. (We had reached the security gate which closes off River Road to everyone.) The biologist said to me, \"This is where the Bowie goatman lives you know? or a Bigfoot. That is if you believe in that stuff. And by the way welcome to your research area, have fun.\" I responded with, \"No matter, nothing in nature scares me.\" He then looked seriously at me and said, \"Until you get to see one.\" 6. One day, several weeks after starting my work at the refuge, I was eating lunch in the office area that we share with **** police. One of the police said to me, \"Hows it going out in the hinterlands?\" I said, \"Fine. No one bothers me and its quiet out there.\" He then said something to the regards of, \"Seen anything creepy or odd yet? That is a strange area.\" I said, \"No\" (however I had already had strange experiences out there, but I did not want to mention anything in case he was testing me). He then mentioned briefly, \"I saw something like a huge dark bear walking on two legs one late night out on River Road, while doing a very rare drive through. I never went back through that place at night again. Only in the day light now.\" I just smirked and mildly laughed and said, \"Bowie goatman, eh?\" He said nothing after that.",
      "TIME_AND_CONDITIONS": "Time: After midnight (~midnight-2am) Lighting: It was very dark with little moon light.

      "ENVIRONMENT": "This individual occurrence was on a riverine island on the **** River located in the center of the restricted, non-access preservation area. The island is completely old growth forest which is mostly brush free and wide open under the dense canopies. The old trees (sycamore, white oak, ash, tulip poplar, red oak) are all 40-90 inch DBH (diameter at breast height) with the lowest branches being ~30 ft. or more off the ground. The age range is 150-500 years old. The canopy is so full that it restricts sunlight to the forest floor. Even during the brightest day on the island it feels like dawn or dust. The ground is full of rich black soil and a nice bed of fallen leaves. Scattered throughout the floor are various forms of edible and poisonous mushrooms. Where holes in the canopy allow sunlight in, there is patches of low bush berry, green briar, and other shrub like vegetation. The entire fringe of the island where sunlight reaches all day is full of smaller trees (pawpaw, young ash, oak, birch, maple, sycamore, cherry, holly) and under which is dense shrubs (ivy, lespidesa, barberry, green briar). Beyond the islands edge to the east side is a ~10-15 ft. wide weathered rock covered beach on the river side. On the opposite side to the west is a muddy steep bank which drops into a deep channeled branch of the river (10-15ft deep). This island very commonly has deer and wild turkey passing through and nesting down. Also an abundance of box turtles lives on this island. The river side were muddy is packed with fresh water clams.",

We were all in our late teens but very experienced campers and very comfortable in the woods. On the 2nd night of our trip we made camp in a low area several miles off the trails near where our topographic map showed a Civil War cemetery was located, though we were unable to find the site. After dinner we sat around the fire as the darkness grew and we all began to feel a bit spooked, as if we were being watched, so we let the fire burn itself out and bedded down. Early the next morning I awoke to a loud wailing which I can only describe as a cross between a lion roar and a screech owl. The noise happened several times and it was very close. At the same time we heard something crashing through the vegetation nearby and what sounded like thick branches cracking and heavy thuds as if large logs or rocks were impacting the forest floor. My friend Bryan and I were sleeping in hammocks over which we had suspended rain ponchos. The ponchos were fastened to the hammocks so we would need to untie them in order to get out and we could not see out either. I whispered to Bryan \"what was that?\". He whispered back \"I don't know\". That was all we said. I was scared out of my mind and did not dare even move my head to try to see anything as I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I was able to look at my watch and determine it was just after 5am. At that moment I resigned myself to my fate, figuring that if something out there wanted me I would have no chance. I made my peace and waited, eventually drifting back off to sleep. Bryan did not sleep at all after the episode and our 3rd friend, Tom, somehow slept through the whole thing. We rose around 6am and broke camp. We looked around for signs of anything unusual but could find nothing.",

      "OBSERVED": "It was in the middle of summer (apx late July, 1989) when I was hiking a well established trail on October mountain. I was approaching the top of the mountain (apx 1200 feet above sea level) when I observed a slight glimps of a moving object about 100 yards ahead of me. October mountain is a heavily wooded area and it was very difficult to see clearly because of all the low brush and scrub. At first all I could see were arms moving and an occassional glimps of a fur covered body. At first I thought I was looking at a large black bear which are not uncommon in the area. I pulled a pair of 40 power biocculars from my travel pack and attempted to focus on the object. Again it was difficult because of all the brush, at one point the animal moved into a slight clearing, it was then that I realized I was observing something very unusual! The animal was very tall (cannot accurately approximate the size) and slightly stooped. Its body was massive and covered completely with reddish hair. I noticed that the head was also very unusual in shape and size. The head was rather pointed and covered with hair or fur. The face was dark in color and had less hair than the top of the head. The neck seemed to be non-existant. At that moment it turned toward me and I was absolutely shocked, it looked very human. At this point I was so frightened, that I took measures to hide myself. After getting over my initial chill I continued to study the animal. It was still in the small clearing and seemed very occupied. It was moving stones and small peices of wood and grubbing for either roots or insects, it was simply to far away for me to see exactly what it was eating. I could see its large arm moving to its mouth every so often. What really took me by suprize was that it was stacking rocks after moving them. One on top of another. This is when I thought perhaps this animal was infact a human, why would it stack rocks in this way? At this point I wanted to get a little closer to see if it was a man in a fur coat or a monkey suit. I checked the wind and made an effort to stay down wind of the animal. I was able to get about 20 yards or so closer to the animal. I found a good observation area and studied the animal closer. At this point I could planly see that this was something very strange indeed, it was not human. The arms were to long and the face seemed very distored and elongated. The arms extended past the nee caps! The hands were very large but human in shape. The fur seemed to be tipped with a lighter color of red. I became so frightened at this point that I began to run back to the trail. I looked back at one point and noticed that the animal had its head back and was slowly moving back into the forest. I don't think it was aware of me, though I wonder how it could have missed hearing me running through the underbrush. I was frightened severly for several weeks and would not hike in that area of the mountain without a hiking partner and a rifle. I will never forget what I saw...never!

You can watch the 8 min video on my blog if you like. www.hikingwithtom.com I always record our adventures on video but this time I decided to run an MP3 recorder all night and get the sounds of the night, I did get what I think was a bobcat walking up to my tent but around 2 AM I was awake again because it was very cold and hard to sleep. I was only half awake when I heard a real loud noise but not awake enough to really tell what it was except that it was a good ways off, I knew I was recording audio so I noted the time so I could find it on my recorder and went back to sleep, or at least I tried too. When I got home I found the sound on my MP3 recorder and it sounds a lot like a wood knock but judging by the amount of echo and how loud it was from so far away It had to be something real big that made that noise. I do not think even Babe Ruth could swing a bat fast and hard enough to make that sound.    The sound is int the video my blog. www.hikingwithtom.com  It sounded like it was a good half mile a way..

We listened for almost a full minute and then decided to continue on the trail, moving closer to the source of the sound.  When we reached the area where we believed the clapping sound to be coming from we listened again and heard nothing and had seen no movement.

It sounded like a human walking, and I thought I was in trouble with the law. My flashlight was dying and I was having trouble seeing just getting the fish off my 2 treble hooks. I asked, \"Who's There?!?!\" and I just heard a stick snap really loud as it stood still. I hit my flashlight in order to make it brighter and I seen big eyeshine and a dark sillouette of what looked to be shoulders.

That's the only way I could describe it. A loud shrieking howl. It wasn't a roar or a deep growl. It was more high pitched. I cut my line with the lure still in the fishes mouth and kicked the fish half hazardly into the water and ran as fast as I could to my car which was the scariest run/walk/stop & listen journey to my car I've ever encountered in my life.

      "OBSERVED": "Twenty Five years ago (1979) I heard the most awful and terrifying screams for 3 nights in a row. We had just built a two story addition which is situated further back on a lot (about 150 feet) into the woods from the street. This area was considered suburban but was fairly rural at that time. There are houses built along the street that are on lots of 3/4 to 1 acre. We own several acres of heavily wooded land and our house sits back on the lot further than the others. The section of woods is borderd by 3 state highways and was about 1 mile (length) by 1 1/2 miles (width)of woods and some farmland fields. At the time there were only two dead end streets that penetrated this section of woods. Another country road separates this section on the west with a State park nearby (1/2 mile from the road). This park is several hundred acres of lakes and heavily wooded areas. The area now is filled with housing and development. It was July and was very hot (90 degrees +) and the peepers were very loud. Each evening between 2:00 and 3:30 a.m. an extremely loud howling, screaming sound would start far away. As it came closer ( the screams lasted for 20-30 seconds each and occurred every 1-2 minutes or so) you could hear bushes and branches being swept out of the way with loud crunching and breaking sounds and screams that would get louder in intensity. The woods at that time were covered with thick vines and brambles that were about 3-5 feet high. It was extremely difficult to walk through any section of the woods that was not cleared. You just didn't stroll through the woods, especially in the pitch black. When this \"thing\" came closer all the peepers and the night sounds completely ceased. The sound was so loud in volume that it actually caused you to \"freeze\" - I mean that it ran your blood cold!  I remember laying in bed not wanting to investigate because whatever it was - it was BIG and I did not want to find out what it was! It was not the sound of a bear, a mountain lion or a wounded deer.The sound had a human quality about it and was like - it was searching for something and had a sense of pain or distress abut it. It would travel parallel through the woods about 100 feet behind my house. On the third night I got up immediately and waited for this thing to get closer. I have a switch in the bedroom that would turn on some roof mounted flood lights that would shine in the back yard. We did not have a deck or anything at the time and the woods were about 25 feet behind the house. This thing was crashing through the woods and when it was right behind the house it gave out this huge loud moan. I was looking out the window with all the inside lights out and then I turned on the floodlights. The scream stopped and there was silence for about 5 seconds and then it crashed through the woods away from the house very quickly opposite the direction it came from. You could hear the crashing of a two footed creature. I heard the crashing sounds for about another minute and then it faded and was quiet. I was really spooked and went downstairs and started turning on all the lights and the outside lights. I noticed that all my neighbors were turning on their outside lights as well. This was unusual because no one left outside lights on and there were no street lights in this section of the street.There were at least 4 other houses that turned their lights on. I contemplated whether to call the police but did not. The next day while mowing the lawn, my elderly neighbor across the street from me came over and said \"Dave, did you hear those sounds last night? I have heard them for several nights and almost called the cops - if I hear it again I am calling the police - I never heard anything like that in my life.\" I agreed and it was good that someone else confirmed the incident to me. All these years I have only told close friends of this story and the kidding I take is unmerciful- but I know to this day what I heard was absolutely real. I forgot about it for many years until I saw some \"bigfoot\" documentary in the early 1990's. They played a recording and when I heard it- it brought back the whole incident. It was almost identical to the sound! I have played the sound recordings on various websights and would say that it was pretty close to the Ohio or Pennsylvania recordings. I never heard anything after 1979 and I did not see anything. Perhaps others have given reports from this area and this report may be helpful. I am being truthful about this - I do not drink or do any nonprescription drugs - I am a church administrator in a Bible (nondenominational) church.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "I do recall now after reading some accounts - about a \"path\" deep in the woods about a mile long that ran parallel to the houses. It was about 500 feet back of my house along an old stone wall. It was covered ( canopy of trees) and very dark-even on bright days. I would occasionally walk through the woods and found this path. The entrance was through the woods 1/4 mile down the street and through a dense pine grove - you would then enter an open field and then enter this dark section of woods. I found an irregular path that rambled - but always wondered why there were many broken branches and samll trees and closed in areas(like small trees pulled together) and the rocks in the wall would be all over the place - some of them were good size. I always thought that maybe some kids used this path to school or built forts or something but I now realize it was too dense and not really in the right direction to the schools.  I never heard any kids out back in all the years I have been here (almost 30 years)",

As I was walking her, I could hear coyotes howling for a good few minutes from a distance and didn't think much of it. Then a few minutes later after it had stopped, I was about to walk inside and heard this loud wailing coming from the woods. It literally sent a chill down my spine. It definitely was not human and not anything else I would recognize. We don't have much wildlife bigger than deer and coyote. This went on till about 5:30 AM and kept me up. The wailing to me almost sounded depressing like it was upset or something. I told my friend's father a few weeks later and he told me that he was out walking his dog a few years earlier and said that he clearly saw something in the woods watching him.

      "OBSERVED": "It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left, it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why. I decided to go back the next day for photographs and I brought a yard stick with me to get these measurements. When returning  the next day I discovered a good size pile of feces on the trail about 15 feet away from the tree I had knocked on. Nothing unusual took place this day but I did take a few pictures of various other things as well which may or may not be relevant. What or who  made those knocks I will probably never know but be clear on this they were distinct, clear, timed and deliberate, of this I am sure.",

      "OBSERVED": "I believe it was May or early June of 1985.  I rented a cabin in the Catoctin State Park with a friend and we just spent one night.  The cabin was just a simple one room building with a window on either side and a cabinet to store your belongings.  There were two army style cots on either side of the cabin, each near a window.  It was very rustic.  The door didn't even have a lock on it, it was just a wooden latch that went through a slot on the door frame. My friend and I hiked during the day and then went to some store and bought submarine sandwiches and a bottle of wine.  As night was fallng we sat out on the tiny porch, ate the sandwiches and split the bottle of wine.  It was a very pleasant evening.  We sat on the porch and talked for several hours, but by the time 10:00 PM rolled around, the combination of all of the hiking and the bottle of wine made us sleepy. My friend and I turned in for the night and we both fell asleep very soon.  My friend is a very heavy sleeper, but I'm a much lighter sleeper.  At some point during the night I was awakened by something.  I didn't know what it was, just that my sleep had been disturbed.  I lay in bed and just listened, starting to fall back asleep when I heard this strange cry off in the distance.  I had no idea what it could be having never heard it before.  I would hear a series of three or four crys and then silence.  Then after about a minute or two it would start up again, only sounding closer each time it started anew.  It was a very weird sound. I just lay there and listened and I kept thinking that the only thing that I could match it up with was the cry of a gibbon that I had heard on TV.  But I thought, that certainly can't be what it is.  I'm not exactly an expert, but I'm a big nature lover and I'm fairly familiar with the common animals of Maryland and I just had no idea what the sound was.  Well, it just kept getting louder and louder each time the next series of cries started.  It sounded like it was maybe a half a neighborhood block away when, even though it was a warm night, I shut the window near my bed because it was so creepy. I tried to gently awaken my friend on the other cot, but to no avail.  I remember that I had to go to the bathroom, but was to uneasy to go out.  There was no bathroom, just the woods.  I stayed awake for about another hour and since I didn't hear the cries anymore, I went out on the porch and urinated as fast as I could and went back in and locked the door and eventually went back to sleep.  I told my friend about it the next day, we had a laugh and that was it.  I have thought about it on and off all these years. What prompted me to report it is that I saw and then bought the Discovery film, \"Sasquatch, Legend Meets Science.\"  There is this segment of the film where this older male scientist and his young female assistant are analyzing these sounds reported to be Sasquatch vocalizations.  When I heard the crys that they were listening to, chills just went up my spine.  They are darn close to, if not exactly what I heard that night in the cabin in Catoctin State Park. I have never heard anything like that in the woods before that night or since, except the first time that I watched that Discovery Special about the efforts of those scientists trying to use scientific disciplines to prove or disprove the existence of Sasquatch.",

The area was dense pine trees and I would guess it was late spring as there was no traffic at all and usually in summer there was even at the time we were travelling, between 3 and 4 AM. We were moving at about 60 to 70 MPH and looking out for deer and were very much awake. I saw a pair of eyes off in the woods some ways up, perhaps 100 meters when I noticed them and as we were closing rapidly I braked fairly heavily. My friend and I saw what I can only describe as an absolutely enormous hairy creature moving VERY fast from the passenger side of the road to the left side. I would estimate it to be at least 8 feet to the shoulder and hunched forward, almost on four legs but definitely NOT a quadruped. It was positively terrifying and we both looked at each other and said \"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?!\". I will never forget the size of the thing.

I currently reside in Pennsylvania in a town name Birdsboro. I recently had weird noises and seen odd things in the woods where I go for spiritual guidance. I seen big rocks placed in a crescent moon shape and found strange scat that had fur and what kinda looked like a cat tail reed top digested in it. Then found a huge tree trunk or broken tree that looks to be placed in the gut of two trees like a football goal post. Just recently, May 29th 2014, I was with a close friend we was in this same location looking for feathers that were molted by eagles. I have a federally recognized tribal ID so am able to pick up those fallen molted feathers. But while we were looking for these it was close to sunset and was right next to a swamp then we hear \"a loud splash\" like there was a huge rock thrown in the water. We both looked at one another in shock cause we were the only two people in the woods then. I thought it coulda been a beaver cause beavers live in the swamp, but thought it was a beaver jumping in the water. Beavers don't make that loud cur-plunk splash we heard, then I thought maybe an eagle may have dropped a big fish in the water like a ,nope wasn't that cause 3mins after we heard the first splash we heard a 2nd splash the same area like 10-15ft away from us. The area is over grown and can barely make your way through in some areas. But heard the noise the 2nd time, we went to look closer didn't see or hear anything in that area but there was a path made through the thick weeds like something went through that area recently cause the tall thick weeds and brush was pushed through like a buffalo was walking through it. When we were leaving the area we heard chattering like someone was talking in the distance but no one was in the woods at the time we was.

I have fished this part of the river since I moved to Maryland from Pennsylvania in 1976. I was fishing on the north bank of the river and noticed a stray large mixed breed dog showing alot of interest on the south bank.  This area has about 100 ft open area before it becomes wooded.  The dog suddenly started to bark and jumped at something that stood up in the brush near the river.  This animal, the best terms I can describe, stood approx. 7-8 ft. and had the shape of a slouching human, full dark brown matted hair covering the body.  The creature was making a ticking sound....hard to describe. The dog lunged at it and quickly was slammed to the ground by the creature.  By this time, I was wading across the shallow area of the river and caught a scent of this animal....reminded me of a heavy musk smell...kind of like that of a fox.  The dog ran away and the creature started to walk into the woods.  I tried to walk behind it, but I was in waders and lost sight of the creature.  I did see the dog a bit later and it had blood on it's mouth and backside. I drove to a phone in Sykesville and called the police.  I was told to return to the scene and wait.  It took me about 3 mins to get back....and a police cruiser (State Police) was already there.  I was immediately told to leave the area.  I returned an hour later and noticed several state vehicles and one federal vehicle as well as police...the area was taped off.  I could see people combing the area....I was told once again to leave.

We parked at ********* road and walked down to the water which took about 10 min. As he was preparing to fish ( I am not really into fishing) I was looking around. I noticed that the fish were jumping so there was a good bit of water splashing, but I heard what sounded like someone running through the water in a shallow area. I asked him what it was but he didn't know and we thought it was just the fish. Then around 10 I saw something moving around in the swamp area (the same area where the wading sounds were coming from. In a split second I saw what appeared to be a large man with rasta type hair. I called for my boyfreind but \"the man\" was already disapearing through the woods. He did happen to see the branches moving though. I asked him what that was but he couldn't tell.

      "OBSERVED": "I am a Ph.D. environmental physiologist working for Natick Labs in Massachusetts. In the fall of 1970, I was hunting on the east side of the lake [Long Pond] in Baxter State Forest with Danny Wolfe, a vet now in Ohio, a friend from Montana (deceased) and another vet. One morning I hunted alone south of the lake, when I encountered a strange musky smell in the woods along with a foot-long black scat that looked human except for the extraordinary thickness and width. I also observed small scat that looked like a large pile of baby feces with white and yellow texture. As I proceeded on, I was confronted with the sound of thumping like a partridge on steroids drumming. The ground actually shook. The hair on my neck was raised and the pit of my stomach seemed suddenly queasy as the rotten smell got worse. Suddenly, a large dead tree came crashing down about a hundred yards in front of me. This scared the s... out of me, as the woods were deathly quiet, no wind, no birds etc. I returned to camp and was severely guffawed by the two vets, Dr. Heisel and Dr. Wolfe. Wolfe, however, agreed to accompany me the next day. We went further into the swampy woods, saw yesterday's scat and Danny said whatever it was it was certainly big to push that dead tree down. We continued until the area became quite rocky with boulders larger than our heads on all sides. Danny said this doesn't look like a good place to be because something could jump us before we could react. Suddenly, we encountered the drumming and ground shaking again. This was followed by a huge rock, which flew over our heads and impacted on a hill to our left. Needless to say, we were both speechless and Danny said whatever could throw a fifty-pound rock fifty yards was not something he would care to encounter. Even though Danny had a 7 mm mag and I had a 270, we both agreed to leave.  It was quite evident that whatever we had pissed off was clearly warning us not to go further.  We returned to camp and my two friends became believers. The hunt was a failure because there were no signs of deer or even moose in the area. We have enjoyed retelling this story to our kids and friends over the years because none of us had ever experienced anything like it in years of hunting in Me, NH, MA, Montana or Colorado. It was the scariest thing I have ever encountered in my hunting career. I have shot elk in Colorado and this year my wife and I shot over fifty pheasants and five deer. I am on the Board of Advisors of the Uxbridge Rod and Gun club, and as the Army's former expert on desert survival and heatstroke physiology (Editorial Board of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine; I wrote the survival manual for Desert Storm and Desert Shield). I have published over 200 scientific papers, abstracts, and book chapters. But this is the first time I have written about this strange encounter!

      "OBSERVED": "Well, I feel queasy even writing this. I went on a camping trip alone for two nights this summer, from July 10th to the 12th, near Lower Richardson Lake (by South Arm, ME). I expected the moose, deer, beavers, chipmunks, woodchucks, and the wild birds.  I did not expect the unusually stormy local weather--or the unusual sounds I heard.  It seemed to rain from the first day I set up camp, until I left early on the afternoon of the 12th. I was camped roughly in between the South Arm camp grounds and the summit of Elephant Mountain, very close to the Appalacian Trail. (North of Andover, ME) I had never been in the area before, And pretty much blazed my own trail up into the old reforested logging area.  I set up my tent on a thirty or forty year old logging road (flat), cut into the side of the mountain.  To further specify my location, I would say I was in the saddle at the source of the Clearwater Brook. (About 3.4 miles up the left side of the stream.) The rain let up for a few hours on the 10th and the 11th in the evenings, long enough for me to make a small cooking fire each night.  On each night, I heard the most unnatural sounds of my life.  My eyes are welling up just writing this. I was in my tent the first night it happened.  I had a new microlight one man tent.  It was basically just big enough to lie down in.  I had just finished eating a fire-warmed MRE, when the noises began.  It started to rain, and I heard, down by a pond about forty yards away or so beneath the logging road, the deep groaning/barking noise.  I thought:  It's a moose..or a wolf?  No... I got really scared.  I bring a Beretta 9mm with me when I camp alone, and let me tell you, I had white knuckles and a ****in' round in the chamber after that shit started up!  Anyway, after about two minutes of these ugly, scary, deep groaning noises, it stopped.  What gets me still, to this day is the fact that some of the sounds reminded me of recordings that I have heard on old shows about Bigfoot (Leonard Nimoy narrated?). SO, the second night, I heard it again a couple of times, and just tried to ignore it.  Damned if I didn't stay awake the whole night.  I got out of there the next day when the rain let up.  I packed my whole camp site up in five minutes and tromped back down to my car briskly (I parked my car in the South Arm Campground parking lot). What gets me to this day is the sound.  I want to be honest with you:  I did not even consider checking it out or investigating.  I did not look for tracks, I did not \"feel investigative\"  at all.  Those noises were enough to scare me out of my wits.  So, I don't know what to tell you.  I have noises. That's it.  I do have pics of my campite, and views from my site, but thats it, really.  I could take you right back there again, if need be. I haven't mentioned this aloud to anyone.  I have put off developing the film on the disposable camera because I know when I see the pics they will remind me of the trip. I just needed to tell someone.  I suppose you can ignore this if you want.  But I do feel better just writing it all out. Thanks, Mark",

If you are familiar with the saddle area, between two moderately sized mountains, you know what kind of terrain it is. Old remnants of logging activity can still be seen.  Mostly just the logging roads in various states of decay.  The forest is reclaiming them. The saddle area had far fewer trees, and was somewhat more exposed to sunlight.  But travel was difficult.  Hundreds of trees are still laying on the ground, and they have been consumed by ground cover and young, new trees. I would say that the logging in the area ceased about thirty years ago. ",

(#4) \"behind the Jones Cemetery.\" at the Durham-Brunswick, Maine line. ",
      "OBSERVED": "(#1) Mrs. Huntington reported (after her own sighting - #3 - the following day) that her daughters have seen the animal three or four times. The first sighting consisted of four youngsters on bicycles seeing it.  The three Huntington children (Lois Huntington, 13; George Huntington Jr., 10; Scott Huntington, 8) and their friend (Tammy Sairo, 12) were riding along the road about a half-mile from the Huntington home.  They matter-of-factly reported an encounter with a chimp. Mrs. Huntington would later tell reporters: \"My 13-year-old daughter fell off her bike about three feet from him and all he did was cock his head and look at her.\"  It was described as upright and chimpanzee-like. The quiet, intelligent, reserved Lois reportedly told the Maine Sunday Telegram: \"I fell right down in front of him and all he did was look at me.  I would have known if it were a hippie or something.  But it had a regular monkey face.  You have seen a monkey before, haven't you?\" (#2) A gorilla-like animal standing on its hind legs was observed two or three times by a James Washburn.  Officers searching the area found moose and deer tracks. (Note by LC - Finding moose tracks anywhere in Maine is not unusual.) (#3) Mrs. George (Meota) Huntington, 33, of Lisbon Falls Road, Durham was driving home from a baseball game when she saw the \"ape\" peeking out from the bushes on the Durham Road. It was twenty feet away, and made a \"mad dash\" on two legs into the heavily wooded area.  The exact description of the \"ape\" was that it was a little over five feet tall, with a shaggy, black coat, and weighing about 350 pounds. She says it had a \"monkey face.\" \"Chimp-like\" was another way it was described. She coasted her vehicle so as not to scare it, but when it apparently saw her vehicle, then it ran into the woods. She reportedly saw it two separate times during this incident, as she returned with neighbors and sighted it again. She stayed in her car, as others searched the woods.  She was sitting in her car, when she saw it again, peering at her from the crotch of a tree. Soon after police were notified, the following arrived to begin a search - Androscoggin Sheriff's Department (a number of deputies), Cumberland County Sheriff's Department, the Maine State Police, and State of Maine Game Wardens.  Altogether, over thirty officers in thirty police cars searched for the animal for two hours. (A helicopter was used in a search in the following days.) Tracks found near a cemetery and not directly associated with the sighting looked human but had claws - they appeared to be of a bear.  At first, that night, some officers brushed off the whole incident as a bear sighting.  This would change. Huntington commented: \"They make it out to a monster.  I never said it was a monster.\" (#4) By Friday, 27 July 1973, several more (unidentifed) witnesses had come forth saying they had seen \"it\".  At 7:30 PM, Peter and Jean Merrill found a footprint behind the Jones Cemetery, the scene of most of the sightings. They said it looked like a chimpanzee print. Androscoggin County Deputy Sheriff Blaine Footman (sic) examined the series of prints, and cast what was described as one which was \"rather deep.\"  Footman said it was about five inches wide with \"the thumb part broken off.  Whatever made it weighs 300 or 350 pounds and I can't tell you much more.  It's definitely not a bear track.  I don't know what's going on here and I'd rather not express an opinion.\" (Reports of a gorilla suit not returned since March to a Portland area costume shop were mentioned in the press, but did not seem to be considered too related to these incidents by the central Maine authorities. By Saturday, 28 July 1973, after many more phone calls from others confirming they had seen an unusual animal in the area, police were taking the sightings very seriously.)

Then barking dies down and another howl....dogs barking...and on and on.continues all night increasing just before daybreak. Then quiet mostly with light of day. I have heard this deep humanish howl alone mostly. And all the years I have been hearing it its the same voice/howl. A few times I heard it with a similar howl but higher pitched. Occasionally I hear it with coyote. Hard to tell if its howling with coyote. Or if coyote just howl because they hear it. It's always its howl first and usually before it stops the coyote start their yips n howls. It usually follows a pattern of movement. Comes in from west travels east, hangs out a long time just east of our house  then continues on past our house until I cannot hear it , then comes back heading west again passing our house. I know this because I wait till its howls have diminished off to east before I go outside to the barn or what ever I need to do out there after dark. I have been out in back a distance from house and heard it howl and it sounding like its only feet away. Incredibly loud. And unnerving. But not nearly as unnerving as it is now (then I thought it was possibly a wolf) now that you think it may be a saqsuach. Well that explains a few things. They say there are no wolves in this area, but I have actually seen a wolf pack chasing deer out of the woods. Happened last fall right across the road. I think the wolves follow the migrating deer herds. In the winter everything gets quiet. Even with last years mild winter. Have not heard howl since around last Christmas. (2012) I recorded it because I was not  sure what it was. I have heard coyote, wolves and dogs howl but this was different. Must have massive lung capacity to be able to sustain a loud and yodeling howl for as long as it does. Not sure how to feel about this.  I think it may have been sleeping in my barn on a few occasions.",

      "OBSERVED": "In late July of 1974, my father, mother, and I decided to take our German Shepherd on an early evening nature walk in the woods by our house. This area is southeast of the intersection of Packard and Carpenter Roads in Pittsfield Township. It was during this trek into the wilderness that I firmly believe that I encountered a Sasquatch, or family of them. Moreover, in retrospect, I have to firmly believe that I had unknowingly come across a nest where the creature was residing at a year earlier. Today this area is heavily developed with condominiums and housing subdivisions, but 34 years ago, this was a different story, as the area had an abundance of deer and other small game. I can remember my neighbor hunting rabbits, and telling me that he saw eight deer standing together in an open field. Likewise, there were wetlands nearby in the area, where we would catch frogs at. The year before, my friends Cooper, Jeff and I had explored the open area, which had a winding path that lead from Packard Road to Montibeller Park, just off Ellsworth Road 1.6 kilometers to the south. We decided to venture further south than usual that afternoon, walking past the New York Central Railroad’s Ypsilanti Branch Line that ran from its namesake city, southwest to Saline, and on into Hillsdale. While walking south into the heavily wooded area from the open field along the trail, we found a very interesting area that we concluded was some sort of a fort. We decided to go into the small area that was two meters inside the tree line, and roughly six meters in diameter. Upon entering, I noticed a rather pungent odor that smelled like a wet dog. What we found was rather amazing. There was a structure made from tree limbs that were pulled down and covered with fresh tree branches. My friend Cooper noticed that the branches had been broken and twisted off, rather than being cut with a saw. Moreover, there were three logs set up as a tripod on the inside of this area, which was covered with some fresh grass that had been torn out from someplace, maybe in the field just south of the old railroad bed. Also, there was a shirt, completely flattened Coca-Cola can, and some aluminum foil on the floor of this fort. It was like being inside an area that was designed to keep the rain off of whoever was staying there. We also noticed that some of the small trees had been snapped off, or bent over in the field just across from this area. I compared them to my arm and noticed that the trees were roughly anywhere from 5 to 18 centimeters in size. We concluded that it must have been from a recent storm, as no person we knew, was that strong to twist a tree of that size. After examining the area for about another 30 minutes, we all decided to head back home, since it was it was getting late and dinnertime was fast approaching. Nearly another year would go by before I would get a chance to back into this wooded area again. I remembering two days after summer vacation started in June, 1974, my friend Jeff asked me to walk down to Montibeller Park with him, as his cousins were having a cookout. We followed the trail and as we approached the area where the makeshift fort was located at, we both had the feeling that we were being watched. I quickly looked inside for a few minutes, and everything was still there. However, we kept going, passing over the large drainage culvert towards the park. After the picnic was over, Jeff’s cousin drove us back home, and I was thankful for the ride, as I was not comfortable walking back through the woods that evening, as it was getting dark. Likewise, the mosquitoes were out in full force in the park, I could just imagine what they would have been like in the woods and wetlands. I would have been their prime menu selection for the night. During the last week of July, 1974, both of my parents were laid off. Feeling rather bored, we decided to take our German Shepherd out for a walk on the trail by where lived at. He had a very outgoing personality, and was never afraid of anyone or anything. Nonetheless, it was about 1900 hours, and overcast that day as we set off on our nature walk. I would have to estimate the temperature was around 26 Celsius. Everything started out just fine, as my parents were talking about my recently departed uncle’s two antique automobiles. Just after we crossed over the now abandoned Ypsilanti Branch Line, heading south towards the thick woods, our dog started to act more conservative and was lagging behind my father. Usually, he led the way, pulling us along for the ride. However, I didn’t give it much thought at first. As we walked along the trail, I heard a very loud “crack” like a large tree branch had snapped around 10-15 meters inside the treeline. Then around a minute later, another loud “pop” from the woods, and our German Shepherd was behaving strangely, growling and looking towards the woods. This is when my father took a hold of his collar as we continued to walk along. Moreover, I had the uncanny feeling that I was being watched, and had an urge to leave the area, but we continued southbound rather slowly. It was at this time I started to smell something terrible, like rotten garbage. My father also commented on the foul odor, hoping there wasn’t a skunk in the area. Likewise, the snapping sounds in the woods seemed to move along with us as we walked. Whatever was in the woods, seemed to walk along with us, and make an occasional loud pop, but then we would hear a much louder snap. Conversely, when we stopped moving, it did the same. I entered area where the man-made fort was located at, and the foul smell was much stronger. Also, our German Shepherd had his tale between his hind legs, and was whining like he was scared. I had never seen him behave like this before. Nevertheless, I noticed a tripod made of sticks to the right side of the trail, not far from where the earlier twisted trees were lying bent over. Just seconds after I had left the man-made fort and turned to walk south, we all heard a tree snap and crash like it had been deliberately broken and fallen down. I would estimate it came from 15 meters inside the woods. While I faced the woods, this sound had come from my right, and there was something stirring to my left. I can remember our dog turning and heading back in the direction we came. This sound convinced my father that a deer must be in the woods, and he didn’t want a “wild buck” to run out and have our dog chase after it. We turned and heading back northbound and the sounds of branches snapping seemed to follow us until we got to the clearing. However, I really felt like I was being watched as we left the area, and it made me feel scared to say the least. In retrospect and after seeing a Bigfoot creature in 2001, and reading numerous reports on the Web, I am thoroughly convinced that I had an earlier encounter with one or more of these creatures in 1974. It’s an event that I will remember until the end of my life.",

We were having coffee in the morning on a weekend, date I cannot recall but it was shortly after, still in February.  As we were having our coffee I was looking off into the woods behind our home and saw a tall pitch black \"ape\" walking from south to the north.  It was erect, however slightly leaning forward, not straight up.  It's arms were long and just kinda swinging loosely as it passed.  It traveled about twenty feet in my view.  I saw only it's right side.  My wife did not see it and it is really hard for her to take me serious.  I don't blame her though.  There was some snow on the ground but very scant.  No foot prints.  Ground was frozen.  I was going to investigate packing my 9mm but took something with more power because this thing was huge.",

      "OTHER_STORIES": "In the fall of 99 my brother was going to hunt deer in our woods and told me he was going to build a blind down by the swamp in the south west of our 20 acres.  An hour or so later I walked back there to see how he was doing.  I heard what sounded like logs being thrown around and I thought it to be strange, like what the hell is he building.  The area is real thick with under growth and trees both living and dead so to get my direction straight I hollered his name.  The sound stopped and I hollered several times only to hear silence.  I remember feeling odd at that time.  I continued forward into the swamp, I was looking down to avoid tripping on debri and I saw for only a second something big move across in between two big bush type trees in front of me.  It didn't make hardly any noise though, it was very light on it's feet not like you would think for something of it's size.  So this part of my story is just odd, not like an actual sighting.  But I do believe (what I saw in February) was a bigfoot. Also a contractor that built a pole building for us told me in a conversation that he hunts an awfull lot north of us a few miles where there is a big swamp.  I asked him if he had seen anything unusual while hunting.  He replied just what are we talking about.  I replied \"you know\" have you seen anything that let's say \"should'nt be there.  He replied no but said that his brother-in-law saw a big hairy ape going under some under brush while he was hunting deer.  It was pitch black and was on all fours.  Just like an ape would move about.  Except he said it was much bigger than any ape he'd seen at the zoo.  He told me how he ridiculed his brother-in-law, as did his brother in law's wife.  Two weeks later his wife saw the thing out a window of their house. She didn't laugh any more. I don't know what else to add to this at this time but will be glad to answer questions.",

      "OBSERVED": "On the first weekend of summer, 1999, two of my sons and a friend planned a Saturday night bonfire in our backyard fire pit to celebrate the end of the school year. They went out about midnight and started a wood fire to throw their books and papers into. After the fire was going, they began to throw the school stuff into the fire. The firepit is almost visible from the couch I was sitting on in the family room on the southwest side of the house. I fell asleep about 12:30 or so, and was awakened by the slam of the bathroom door at about 1:30 AM. I asked the boys what was wrong, and my younger son and his friend were crying. The oldest son was white faced and visibly shaken. They apparently heard what sounded like women screaming at the back of our yard, to the west, then north, then east, like the screamers were surrounding our yard and taking turns making the screams. The boys said that the screams sounded like they started high pitched, then descended into a low growl and were moving. I used to be an avid hunter and target shooter, but, as I moved around the country for my job, I got tired of learning new rules, etc., and stopped hunting, but I still had a few guns and police grade flashlights around the house. When we moved to this semirural area, I had a standing deal with my sons that they would get me if anything unusual happened around our property, no matter what. This time, though, they never got me up to tell me what happened. By the time I figured out that they heard something unusual (at the time I thought a local girl was being harrassed by local punks), and I got out the back door with a light, whoever/whatever was there was gone. They didn't want to call the police because they were afraid I would tease them, let alone the police, who might think they were lying. The next morning, my sons took me out back to the field behind our property, but we found nothing. The following Tuesday night, just at dusk, my middle son heard the same scream and movement in the corn field on the east side of our house, and ran in, badly shaken. Again, I ran out, this time armed as well as with a good light, but saw and heard nothing.

      "OBSERVED": "My boyfriend and two sons (age 5 & 10) were camping in Upton, Maine.  On July 3rd, 1998 we took a ride into Parmachenee Lake.  The road to get there is off Rt. 16 in Wilsons Mills, ME.  We drove around most of the day, stopped for a cookout on someones lot and then headed out in the early afternoon.   It was before 4:00 p.m.   We were riding in a truck, my friend driving and the two boys in the middle and I was on the passenger side.   We came out of what I would call a wooded area at the top of a small hill, the hill rounded a small corner and then straightened out at the bottom.  The entire area on the right side was an open area at the bottom, the left side was wooded.  There were no vehicles around there or anywhere for that matter.   Just as we rounded we could see at the very bottom of the slight downgrade (approx. 100-150 yds).   We both saw it at the same time.  He looked at me immediately and said \"what did you just see\", I looked at him and without even thinking and said \"saskatchewan\". What we saw was something unimaginable.   The creature (?) was standing on two legs, was very tall (approx. 7 feet), skinney and was totally covered with long brown hair/fur.  What was amazing was this creature never even acknowledged that we were coming towards him in the truck, although we were not close enough to hit it, it never acknowledged.   The other amazing thing was that it's strides were huge.  It took it probably three strides to cross the dirt road, which was wide enough for two vehicles.   It's gait was very stoic.   We got down to the bottom within seconds, we slowed right down almost to a stop and looked into the woods.   There was nothing in there.   My boyfriend wanted to stop but I wouldn't let him because of the children.  We also stopped discussing it at that time in fear of scaring the kids.  There were no tracks on the ground.   We intended to return the next day to see if we could track anything but it rained really hard that night so we figured any tracks were gone. I told this story to very few people because I know it's hard to believe.   I did tell one of the foresters that worked where I did.   This road we went on is gated and I was able to get a key from my employer.   This is why I mentioned it to the forester.  I was hoping maybe he had heard similar stories.

He was spending the night in the Chevy Open Road camper, parked in our driveway, which our parents owned at the time. It was a Saturday night in the early summer. He considered it cool to spend the night in the camper. At that time there had been a 'flap' of sightings in the area, and WDCA Ch. 20 had been playing up on this during their midnight 'Creature Feature' horror movies. At the end of the movie, I jokingly took a BB pistol to my brother to protect himself should he encounter one. At about 1:30 am, he had shut the TV off and was going to sleep when he noticed a shadow which was cutting back and forth thru the window of the camper (it was closed curtain). The shadow was from a light in our nextdoor neighbor's yard back porch light, which was a 'clear shot' between the camper and the porch (no wind, trees to block, etc.) He got real quiet and watched as the shadow moved closer to the camper. This type of camper had a translucent plastic roof, and if a light was shone on the roof, you could easily see it, or a shadow. Needless to say, the thing came up and slowly walked around the camper, lightly tapping the sides of the camper while walking around it.He could also see the shadow of a 'head' through the roof, so the thing has to be around 9-10 ft. tall to do this. The next morning he came in at the crack of dawn and told what happened -! He didn't sleep at all and was scared stiff. We found fingerprint smudges on the sides of the van, and a handprint on the hood which was quite large, about 6-7 '' wide. There were also large toeprints in some sand which was spilled in the yard. We don't know what it was, but it was real, and very large.",

      "OBSERVED": "I came across your website, and decided to look for reports in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. After reading the posted reports, I thought I'd share the following: I resided in the Annapolis area for approximately 8 years, from 1969-1977, and lived in numerous areas in and around the city. In 1972-73, I was living in the Saferan (sp?) area, outside of Epping Forest, on the outskirts of Annapolis. This area was a wooded peninsula extending into the Severn River. During the summer of '72 or '73, I was 10-11 years old. One evening I awoke because of the summer heat. My bed lay roughly 2 feet from and parallel to the bedroom window. The bedroom window was on the ground floor level and faced a roadway lit by a single street light in this area. I recall having just awoke and sat upright in bed, looking to my left at the floor fan. I recall thinking that the evening was very, very hot. As I sat in my bed waking up, I turned to my right, looking directly into the window. What I saw can only be described as a large head, with distinct hair covering it; it was much, much larger than any human head. I recall seeing the thing's eyes blinking at me, from a distance of 2-4 feet. I also recall seeing the teeth in it's mouth. The eyes and the teeth contrasted sharply from the darkness of the rest of the head. The light from the roadway was behind and to the thing's left, so I wasn't able to make out any distinct features, other than the eyes and the teeth. There were no sounds other than the fan. This thing was making no threatening moves, in fact it was doing nothing other than looking into my bedroom window and seeing me looking at it. After maybe 10-15 seconds, during which time I went from trying to comprehend what I was seeing to being very, very frightened, I lay back down on my bed, rolled off the bed to my left and crawled out of my bedroom on my hands and knees to a bathroom. My mother found me sometime in the bathroom. When I relayed the story to her, she told me the curtains were closed and to go back to bed. I know the curtains weren't closed, but, thanks mom.

Theres a steam that runs by Shipey's Choice and Ben Oaks across the road. At that time Shipey's Choice was a new sub-division where homes were being built. The steam was at the bottom below two hills. I recall playing around the steam and following it back to Ben Oaks. I was alone and remember feeling like I was being watched. I looked up the hill in the area of the new sub-division about 250 ft. away and saw a bigfoot maybe 7-8 ft. tall. I didn't know what it was at first. It was dark brown and big.

      "OBSERVED": "On 7 Oct 01, at approximately 6:30 pm (twilight) in the Severn Run State Park, while researching a previous sighting of an animal in this area, I spotted another animal, which had frozen in position (to avoid detection, it must have heard my car door shut), at a distance of approx 150 yards off the roadway. The temperature had dropped dramatically, causing a fog to rise over a stream between myself and the animal, partly obscuring my view. I had parked alongside the road, and was standing behind my car, looking into the woods when I spotted the animal standing in the undergrowth (growth is approximately five feet tall, and the animal was approximately three feet above that, slightly bent over). Severn Run State Park, is a state stocked trout stream, which runs from the Odenton area to the Severn River near Annapolis, the state capitol and home of the US Naval Academy. The woods here at this location are mature trees, with lots of undergrowth, no \"middle growth\" trees, so visibility is good through the growth. Lots of greenbriar and small trees approximately five feet tall. The animal was traveling towards Odenton, and was facing towards the right. Its head was lowered slightly, looking in my direction and was turned in such a way that I could only see one arm, the back, and its face. The animal was a light tan in color, approx 8-9 feet tall. It had large eyebrow ridges which cast a shadow over its eyes (didn't see eyes), a large jaw, a roundish face, MASSIVE shoulder muscles, and huge biceps. The animal had long head hair, which extended down to about the bottom of its shoulder blades. No hair hung over its face. The hair on the body of the animal appeared to be short and tight to the body, not shaggy or matted. Coloration was constant over the body and head. I yelled \"HEY!\", clapped my hands and whistled. The animal wouldn't move. After approximately 15 min I left the area.  It was too dark for any photos to turn out from my cheap camera. The exact location is currently under observation by the BFRO, and will be revealed at a later date. Thank you for your understanding.",

So I peaked my head out to see but it was too dark so I yelled to \"shutup\" and the being ran away. Once again I thought it was my friends just playin around so I wasn't concerned and I didn't investigate. When the sun rose we started packing up and notice huge footprints in the sand that led into the trees coming from the water.

It moved east to west hollering jibberish and moving closer and closer to where I was.  I unzipped the back of the deer blind to try and see with my field glasses what was making all that noise and scaring the deer away.  I saw nothing.  The sound was getting closer and I began to feel nervous even though I had permission to hunt there. Thats when the smell of damp musty roadkill mixed with dirty diapers hit me.  I had to exit the deer blind for fresh air and an overwhelming sense of fear gripped me. It was more of a safety issue that made me exit the deer blind and nock an arrow in my bow and leave the area as fast as I could before I came in contact with whatever was making the noise.  I was unnerved by the aggresive tone in the jibberish and hollering. The fact that it was close by and I could not see it coupled with the smell and the tone of its voice, made me realize that I had best leave the area, and quickly. As I exited the woods, I walked briskly towards my vehicle and was approximately twenty five yards from my truck when I heard more loud jibberish coming paralell from me about twenty yards in the woods.  Whatever it was was following me and that unnerved me even more and I headed straight for my truck with my bow fully drawn and ready to fire at whatever was stalking me.  Again, I saw nothing.  No movement in the woods and I made my way to my truck and released my draw without shooting my arrow.  I put my bow in the back seat of my Suburban and cranked up my truck and left immediately.

      "OBSERVED": "I am a 44 yr. old woman, I am submitting this in request of my husband & grown son.  As an avid 'birder' (loves bird watching), I was taking an early morning walk (6:45 a.m.) around Oxbow Lake to see what birds were 'out & about'. Almost as soon as I started the short trail around the lake, I noticed that there was no activity.....none, no birds, no deer, no squirrels, nothing. This seemed VERY odd to me, because it was a beautiful spring morning, the sun was shining and there wasn't even the smallest breeze in the air. Then I noticed that the birds weren't even singing, I could not hear one bird song or call, which is very unusual because there is ALWAYS a lot of bird activity here, especially in the early morning. Then, I noticed that not even the frogs, or the peepers were making any sound...it was complete silence. When I reached the part of the trail where I usually see deer, there was nothing. It was just about in this area where I started to smell this terrible odor....hard to explain, a strong musky smell, not like a dog or a skunk but a definite heavy odor of musk, one I have never smelled before and I have spent a lot of time in the woods. While I was standing quietly trying to figure out what/where the odor was coming from, a live tree 30-40 ft. high (unknown species) fell about 100-150 ft. from me, it just fell, and there was not even a small breeze that day! I have spent my childhood in the deep woods of Adirondack Mountains. and this just went against every natural law I could think of.....and believe me I tried to rationalize this! I then had this intense feeling that I was being watched...no more like being stared at, and then I got the sense that perhaps the tree had been pushed, like a warning. I decided I should start making my way back towards my car, still not hearing or seeing ANY wildlife. Just before getting back in my car I went to an overlook and all of a sudden I heard from the opposite side of the lake a loud howling, it echoed thru the marsh area. After 3-4 deep, loud howls, again silence. I walked back to my car and drove home.",

It was summer and the sun was getting ready to go down so it was dusk-like -- I turned - and by the way so did the dog - our Labrador Retriever -  and could not believe my eyes. I observed a large - I am guessing 10-11 feet high - ape-like figure stalking in the woods behind the pond - I would say it was about 100 yards away.  I just froze - and so did our dog.  No one else witnessed this and we just both stood there for what seemed like 2 minutes - until the creature turned and looked our way and then slowly turned and dashed back off in to the woods....never to be seen again.  I remember this like it was yesterday but did not know about this site until today when my awesome nephew, AB, told me about  it.....so....here I am today...reporting this incident so everyone can be aware and know the truth.",

Figuring it to be maybe a hunter (I was ignorant of hunting seasons at the time- so I could not rule that out), I turned around to head towards the woody hillside along the driveway to greet the hunter, or to threaten him off the property (my grandfather allowed certain people to hunt deer when in season) from a safe distance. however, instead of seeing a person with reflective gear, I saw a large, tall shadowy figure with odd eyes- its eyes glowed red, probably from a reflection or something... it slowly backed away though, and headed up the hillside. Scared, i ran back to my grandparents home and told my folks i saw something- (they told me it was a fox, but i know from wat i saw that is impossible) They all laughed it off. But on the way going back down the driveway, my folks stopped because one dropped something in the car. while our car was temporarily not moving, I curiously looked out the window and over toward the hillside, and i could make out the shadow and the eyes. I was 8 at the time, but I was rather intelligent for a kid- I knew what a deer looked like, what a fox looked like. Since that time in 1993, Ive heard sounds and reports of similar activity. Ive also noticed the occasional long shadowy figures and eyes, but from a safer distance (and from my car!) and long after i started to get used to the things.",

      "OBSERVED": "In mid spring of this year, I was hiking through the woods with a friend in the middle of the night. Making our way up onto a trail, we stumbled upon a picnic table and decided to sit down and rest. We were startled to find the whole ground glowing green around us. Using my headlamp, we attempted to spot whatever was causing these little glowing green dots. At the time we had no clue what was causing this to happen, but we later realized that firefly larvae were lighting up the forest floor. Seeing the glows coming more intensely from a nearby hillside deeper in the woods, we decided to scan the the hillside with our headlamp. As soon as we shined the headlamp, we caught a pair or grapefruit sized bright green (with a slight hint of gold) eye reflections peering over the crest of the hill. We stood in shock, never removing the light from those eyes. \"Maybe its a deer,\" she said. A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us. \"See,\" I say, \"It is just a deer.\" As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet. It slowly occurred to be that I had never seen eye reflections of this color and that the closest thing might be a bear. Suddenly I hear a slight rustling behind me. Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes. They too were grapefruit sized and green, but were spookily sneaking up on us from behind. I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear. we hurried out of the area, terrified, and made our way south to a different hiking area to take the whole situation in. Again we noticed firefly larvae, but when we began to approach the woods (which in fact are connected to the last area by water system) a bunch of creatures began running around in the woods, breaking branches and shaking bushes and trees. Later, upon watching one of your videos and discussing the experience with some knowledgable peers, I realized that I had experienced a sasquatch encounter.  Returning to the same spot some 2 or 3 months later with a few buddies, we were able to catch the same eye reflections for a very short period of time.",

I live on and drive up and down Carrollton Rd several times a week. What I noticed was a fresh break of a young tree, about 50-60 feet in from the road. Due to brambles, and being private property, I didn't go in for exact measurements but I'm a pretty good estimator. This break is about 6 feet off the ground, maybe 5, the tree is approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. I noticed that there are significant scrape marks on one the road side of the tree, can't see the other side, The marks are ONLY below the break. I also found what looks like definite depressions in the leaf litter, with a bit of compressed bare ground, one about 6 feet in from the road at the tree line, and one about 2 feet from the guardrail. I carry a tape measure with me in my car as part of my tools for farriery, so I was able to lay it out at what I believe is the length of the depressions and get pictures. Of course I couldn't resist doing a few knocks, there were some good rocks at the roadside so I did one knock, waited about 10 seconds then did two more about 2 seconds apart. I waited about two seconds, stood up, took two steps and heard a response knock!!! It sounded like it was certainly past the hill (top is about 3-500 yards from road) and probably well past that, guessing within a half mile. I waited about 30 seconds, put out a few more knocks, nothing. Couldn't help a few short whoops, no response.",

Walking up the road about 50 feet and looking around the south side, I did notice a big lay of fallen timber, several old 8-16 inch trunks together that would possibly make a hiding place if needed. This area in general is full of little gully creeks and feeder streams.

We parked in the town of Knoxville Maryland and crossed the rail road tracks to get to the river. We were fishing in a brach of the Potomac that was about 600 meters long before it went back into the river. We got to the spot around 8:00 AM we had our backs to the Potomac when fishing the banks of the branch. Behind us was the Potomac. There was an island that was about 600 meters long and about 200 meters at it widest point. The island is a hill and you can't see the Potomac from were we were fishing. We were only there about Five mintues when heard what sounded like a dying deer. My friend heard it too, I said it sounds like some one shot a deer and it was dying. This whole time we were walking down the river and fishing at the same time. As I got farther down the branch of the river my friend said what is that alful smell. I said it must be that deer. My friend said that is the worst smell I have ever smelt before. Then we heard some thing moving behind us on the island. I was thinking that deer is not dead yet. I started to walk across the water (which was about three feet deep) to the other side to see it. As I was walking I could smell it and it was getting worst. My friend said what is it, I don;t know I can't see any thing but I can smell it. He started walking over towards me. He was walking with the river (south east) I was standing in front of a hill and could not see over it. Wear he was walking from he could see over the hill. I was about 50 meters down river from him. He said John I see some thing, I said is it a deer. No I think it is a bear. I started to walk back and towards him. I was hoping it was not going to atttack us. I said lets go some place else. I wanted to fish not get attacked by a bear. He was walking to me and I was walking towards him I said lets go. Then were heard it again and I said that dose not sound like a bear.He said No but it might be a bigfoot. I said all the more reasons to go some place else. As I got to the bank acrossed from the island I got up on land to see if I could see it. He was still in the water but walking towards the bank wear I was standing. I could not see any thing but I did hear some thing walking on the other side of the hill. I said maybe it was a hunter and he killed a deer and now he is coming over the hill back to his car draging the deer. The steps were getting louader and I could smell the smell with every breath. At this point I am ready to run. I was a 4:18 miler in college and I was hoping my feet don't fail me now. It stopped and we could not hear it any more. I would have ran like hell if I would have seen a bigfoot. That might have been the day I went sub 4:00 in the mile. We left and talked about all day long. We still talking about it.

We had all grown up in and around the woods but this sound was louder and so unusual that we all turned around at the same time.  When we first saw it, behind us, at the same spot we had just come from a few minutes before.  It was walking up the hill to the top of the RR tracks. We were about 110 feet away. It had its head bent down and turned sideways toward us but never stopped walking straight across the tracks and down the other side. There was a well used trail along the creek south of the tracks but north of the tracks is all swamp and no trail at all. The North side is wet peat bogs, thick brush, cedar, spruce and balsam and poplar trees with small tag alders. We stood there for a minute or so and then ran back to where it went into the woods.  We couldn’t find the exact spot but the smell was still there.  It smelled like a wet decomposing animal mixed with rotten fish.  We couldn’t find any tracks but then the swamp is so thick and wet that we didn’t look very far into it – besides we were all a little stressed out and kept looking over our shoulders for more to come from where he came.  The trail south of the Tracks, where he came from, was too hard for tracks. We all agreed to never speak of it to anyone.  There were a few reasons for this; 1.\tWe new that everyone would laugh at us. 2.\tThis was something that only we new about and we named it “Marblehead Monster” 3.\tAlthough we didn’t own this area or creek, it felt like we did, and we didn’t want a bunch of people stumbling around and messing everything up for us. 4.\tThis was a time BEFORE Bigfoot.  There were no Bigfoot sightings and he hadn’t even been named yet.  We had no information to compare with our sighting.

It's face appeared hairless, while the rest of the body was covered in longish light colored hair (whitish) with a darker tone on it's back.  It stood hunched over approximately 5 feet tall.  If it were to stand up perhaps another foot or two could be added to it's height.  It had narrow shoulders like a human.  It's arms were longer than humans.  While hunched over, it's hands could almost reach the ground.  The legs had haunches similar to a dog.  I do not recall the way the feet looked or whether it had a tail or not.  It's face looked like a monkeys, with wide eyes, two nostrils were visible, nose flat, it's mouth was like a slice - going straight across it's face.  When it stepped out of the night and into our yard, our light post was bright and it squinted.  When it squinted at the light, it's eyes and forehead became clear.  The wrinkled expression of squinting it's eyes, creating folds and / or wrinkles that went all the way up it's forehead before the hair.  That's when it became obvious that it's forehead was slanted back like a monkey and not like a human.  The forehead had quite a slant and took up almost 1/2 of it's face, it seemed.  As it walked, it walked primarily on it's back two legs, using also it's front right hand, which caused a sort of rolling gait to it's stride.  It held it's left hand higher above the ground, as if it might be injured.  (Perhaps from the sound of it's encounter with the dogs to the east of our house.) It no longer seemed in a hurry.  It turned from the light and walked slowly down the driveway. I yelled to my dad who was downstairs, do you want to know what the dogs have been barking at? I ran downstairs finishing my sentence, telling him that it was walking in our yard.  My father ran outside with a gun to shoot it, and could not locate it in the dark.  I don't think the moon was out that night.  My dad did have a flashlight though and our front yard is full of trees.  As my dad was looking all over the ground, thinking it was small, I became scared and believed that the creature could have easily climbed a tree, for hiding.

I went in the woods walking through the rows of pine trees so that it would be easy to find my way back to the car. At about one hundred fifty yards in, I heard load crashing to my left. Thinking that I may have spooked a deer I froze and looked around. The crashing stopped when I stopped. As I took a few steps,   I heard the crashing in the woods again. I stopped again and so did it. But I noticed that instead of going away from me it was coming to me. I then took a couple of more steps then it was getting really close to me. I jumped to the next row of pines and squatted down so that I could look around. The branches started at about four feet from the ground. I suddenly noticed an awful odor from the area of the noise. Then I heard another crunch of branches and a big white furry leg stepped in the same row as me. I could see a good four feet of legs that were about seven inches around but it wasn't up to where the thigh gets big. It was only about twenty five yards to my left. The thought of shooting it came and went. It was huge and I didn't know was it was, and what would happen if my 30 30 didn't take it down.  I didn't move, and after squatting there for about ten min. It went on its way. I waited until I couldn't hear it any more, I ran back to the car and waited for the others to come back. I never mentioned this for years.",

At this time the town was small and had various thickly wooded lots here and there right inside city limits.  We were used to wild animals and many of the neighbors were regular hunters.  The serious type, with dogs and all.  I haven't been to Rogers City in quite a while so I don't know how much it has grown and I'll bet the forested lots are gone by now.  Across the street from our house was one of these lots.  It was so thickly wooded that a person couldn't see into it.  We (and the neighbors) kept hearing blast horn howl moaning type sounds.  These sounds are exactly comparable to the Ohio Howl (the ones with the dog barking in the background).  The lot was next to a cemetary on the left side as we faced it.  So to my older sister and me, we thought the sounds were attributable to a haunting.  The sounds had a terrifying ring to them as no one knew exactly what they were.  No dogs or people would dare go near the thicket.  Between the woods and the cemetary was a narrow road...half gravel and half crusher run.  We used to ride our bikes down this road as it was a short cut to friends houses.  My mom said \"it was very lonely down that road and stay away from there.\"  But we (sister and I) snuck down it anyway..real quicky on our bikes.  One sunny early spring afternoon, the snow had melted enough to bring out the bikes.  My older sis and I were on our way home...down the forbidden road.  She happened to look into the thick forest. She stopped and I did too...we both looked.  She said \"look, over there towards the middle of the lot...what is that!  It looked like a black burned out stump. It was the only thing on the lot that looked like that so we thought a tree had been struck by lightening and burned black.  Then the breeze blew.  Long black hair fluttered in the wind off the stump!! Then sis said that it looked like an old Indian sitting cross legged and covered with black long hair.  I could see a funny flat face (no snout, this was not a bear, it looked apelike..we had seen bears playing in the city dump so we knew what they looked like) with a pug nose, a low forhead, arms that looked long (resembled a praying mantis) and long legs crossed like people sit cross legged. The stump had a domed top and was at least 5 to 6 feet (in the sitting position)tall. Sis looked at me, white faced and terrified. She said I want you to get on your bike and peddle as fast as you can to the house.  What ever you do, don't stop and don't look back.  I'm going to do the same.  So we hopped on those bikes and peddled for our lives.  Sis had an English made touring bike that could really put on the speed.  I had an ordinary bike but I kept up with her.  To any one looking my feet would have been a blur.  This was REAL scary.  I can still feel the fear an see sis white face.  When we got home we threw the bikes in a heap in the garage and dashed inside the house.  Mom saw the fear and asked what had happened.  We told her about the big hairy black stump with a face.  We were grounded when we told her where we had been.  She believed us..I don't know why..she picked up on our fear and knew that we had seen \"something.\"  It was a long time til we rode those bikes again and we never went near that road or the thicket again either!!!",

We waited until everyone was back in camp before our search for the deer. At that time I could carry a hand gun in the woods. We went out with a coleman lantern for the search.We went back to the tree stand and looked for blood. We followed the trail and it stopped. We looked all around and then we heard a noise that got our attention. I held the lantern high to see farther with no avail. Next we heard foot steps...pacing back and forth, heavy steps that had a lot of weight behind them..deliberate to get our attention..it did. We could barely make out the outline it appeared to stand 7 foot or so, could not make out features well. We believe that it took the deer and just wanted us to go away. Next it made this gutteral sound a warning so it seemed. I never heard anything like it in the woods before...hard to describe. We felt threatened and I took out my  hand gun and said if it came into the light I would use the pistol.Slowly we back tracked out from the area and back to camp. Next morning we looked for the deer and for any prints...nothing. In 2004 or 2005 the creature returned one evening way early in the moonlit morning (maybe2:00AM or 3:00 AM) and it was just outside of our cabin looking under a tarp that covered our firewood.

For this reason I would like to remain anonymous but thought it would be of value to report my experience. My wife and daughter and I were staying at a friends newly built cabin up in the Michigan UP.  The cabin is on the shore of lake Superior in a desolate area on a dirt road not too far away from the nearest town.  I was amazed by the quietness of the forest area and the very tall pine tree stands.  At 9:30 PM my wife was reading a story to my daughter in bed and I was laying on a mattress right next to the window.  All of a sudden I heard Whoooop  Whoooop, long pause, Whoooop, Whoooop, long pause, Whoooop, Whoooop.  The pitch was rising from low to high.  The first thing that went through my mind was “what the hell is that?”  The sound came from a thick area of pine trees to the west of the property.  The next thing I noted was  the incredible volume of the sound.  Even though it was probably 150 yards away, it was so loud that it echoed off of the trees.  To me it was a very “zoo sound,”  It sounded so much like a primate that it gave me chills.  The vocalization sounded almost exactly like the “whooping” on the Sierra sounds webpage. Up until that moment, bigfoot had not crossed my mind at all. Let me add that I have had about 25 years of experience hiking, camping and fishing in the Sierras and throughout the country and I had never heard a sound like that.  It clearly was not an owl, bear, loon, coyote or moose.  I have heard similar sounds on the internet as well. There are multiple creeks and swampy areas as well as lots of blueberries.  There are thick stands of pine trees. It had rained earlier in the day.  Some of our group were out picking blueberries during the day, I was out fishing that day on a nearby river and in lake Superior. I’m aware that there was credible sighting in 1998 by a bear hunter on the Firesteel river in Greenland county less than 5 mi away from the cabin that I was staying at.  Also, there is an account of an Ontonagon logger who claimed that 2 bigfoots rescued him from under a fallen log.  Those 2 incidents  got me thinking that there may be some reality to what I heard. The thought of the existence of another bipedal primate is a shock to most people, including me. I did not make an effort to investigate the area where the noises came from in the morning.  Partly because we were busy taking care of small children and I was not prepared to have an encounter.  Next time I go to the UP I’ll keep my camera ready.",

I saw on one walk an animal of tall stature, peaking out from underbrush, the head between five and six feet in height from the ground and the body was hidden. On the property were many \"bear dens\" and other areas that could provide shelter. I also saw deer carcasses cached high in trees. I saw as well, bone pillars. Piles of bones stacked two and three feet high in a very dense area of the wood. I have heard sounds, hard breathing, but not like a buck or deer, or bear. Certainly of a large animal. During a walk after dark I was chase by an enormous creature which ran on two feet and was most definately not human. Frequently, there was a feeling of being watched.....Also during this time period there were a lot of deer kills being attributed to wild dogs, I had no encounters with wild dogs in that area or their tracks or sign. Any time it felt like the creature was near there was a distinctive musk odor. Also some odd calls were let out before the chase in the dark....like nothing I had ever heard. This is in White River Township.  I will tell you, there is more than one type of \"bigfoot\" living out there, the larger more reported, and a smaller not so reported. The smaller has closer to humanlike features, and resides in upper Michigan. It has the appearance of an early ape-man on the evolutionary track....I can't think of which one. This one runs...it has not got the aggresive nature of the larger, This is the one frequently confused as a human spirit in native mythology.",

      "OBSERVED": "It was late September 1980, mid-morning on a Saturday with sunny, calm and cool weather.  Perfect for squirrel hunting, so off I went, not telling anyone where I was going (I had a number of different spots).  I headed for a small woodlot, maybe 10 acres in size, less than a mile from my house.  This woodlot is about 1/3 mile from the nearest road, surrounded by farmland with a small stream on the south side and with several fence rows attached.  It had a farmer’s lane that went though it in a rough L shape, with a grass and dirt base and large enough to drive on.  Such woodlots are a fairly common feature of the southeastern Michigan farming landscape, if anything the woodlot was smaller than most. The lane enters the woodlot from the north, about ½ mile from the road I first walked onto the lane from.  As I entered the woodlot I noticed something quite odd- there were a large number of birds making a big racquet in the underbrush in the woods just to the right of the lane.  I noticed redwings, robins, jays and cardinals in particular, and they were flirting about the underbrush in a somewhat frenzied fashion.  Many times I had seen redwings gather in large noisy flocks this time of year (pre-migration or corn field raids), but gather high up – this was different and struck me as strange.  I continued my way, after 50 yards or so into the woodlot I approached a small bend in the lane where it veers perhaps 20 degrees or so to my right.  My rifle was still slung over my shoulder with a sling, since the hunting spot was on the other side of woodlot near the lane exit on the west side. At the bend in the lane I was still glancing back at the bird commotion, and when I turned my head forward again I froze in shock and terror.  Standing about 25 yards away was a huge furry creature, towering 7 feet into the air and standing just like a man.  It was staring seemly straight through me, and our eyes locked.  It stood in the underbrush just off the left side of trail.  I could not see it below the waist, but could see everything else.  It could see me from head to toe.  We just stared at one another. It was massive, three feet wide at the shoulders, incredibly stocky and strong looking.  Reddish brown hair was everywhere, shorter on the face but perhaps 3-5 inches long on the head and shoulders.  The hair was quite unkempt and mop-like especially on the top of the head.  The head was large, seemingly flat on top.  I could not make out any ears.  Eyes a simple black, no whites, and a lying flat nose without many discernable features – there was even some hair there in the middle of the face.  The mouth was large with a bit more hair there, giving the appearance of a sort of mustache.  It did not have much expression, pretty much straight lipped, it really seemed almost relaxed.  Its arms hung at its sides, with the hands in the underbrush.  There were no signs of aggression.  Perhaps that is what kept me from panicking, and neither it nor I moved a muscle.  That eerie stare seemed to last forever.  My mind raced, desperate to escape.  I felt that turning and running might encourage it to chase me, and I knew I could never outpace it.  I did not attempt to unsling my rifle, fearing that it might consider such a move aggressive.  Also, it was only a single shot .22, obviously of little use for something this size.  The rifle was chambered but un-cocked, and if the creature charged I would probably not even have the time to cock it.  I did not want to shoot this creature, but would in self-defense.  So, barely moving my hand that was at my side I could reach back to the bolt knob and try to cock the gun while it was still slung on my shoulder.  I could move the spring a little, trying several times, but from there I could just not get enough leverage to pull it all the way back.  I will never forget how hopeless I felt at that moment.  I had no idea what to do next, and just stood there. Then the creature made its move – its large hairy right hand came up, and swiped at a red berried shrub right in front of it.  It moved the hand to its mouth and casually chewed.  It repeated these motions- glancing down to the shrub, swiping up berries and eating, then glancing back up to me.  The arm motion was very fluid and un-human like, no jerking motions, very deft flowing movement.  The left hand remained at the creature’s side.  It was not picking berries like a person would, it was raking them up.  Also, during the entire encounter I never heard any vocalizations or smelled any odors. Watching it eat, I started to feel better.  I was no longer this creature’s only concern, so I took this as an invite to leave.  I slowly began to walk backwards, and the creature continued to eat and keep an eye on me.  I slipped around the bend, and lost sight of the creature after a few feet.  I turned around and quickened my pace into a fast walk, not wanting to alert the creature that I was running or in panic.  I continued to look back to the bend in the lane, fearing it would follow.  Soon I was at the woodlot’s edge, and broke into a full run.  Finally, only to run faster, did I unsling my rifle. I was 15 years old, and it probably did not take me two weeks afterwards to clam up about this for obvious reasons.  In the mid 1990s I told my future wife, and now am reporting it here.  It just feels like it is time.",

We both stopped, and were in shock, and we said \"oh my God what was it\"! We had both windows part way down on my pickup truck, and we could smell an awful odor, like rotten eggs. Then about 30 seconds later my friend and I both said \"Bigfoot\" at about the same time. The creature was about 7-8 feet tall, and was very well built.

As he approached a curve my brother who says he’s never spoke about this to his family and only to a close personal friend, observed what he thought was a bear or a very large black dog on all fours in the distance. From the lights of headlamps he said the big black dog appeared to be rooting in the trash and paused only as it caught a glimpse of his approaching headlights. Rounding the curve and heading straight forward he says the black object became clearer and larger as he approached. When he continued forward the animal then on all fours rises on two feet towering above his tiny Geo tracker. It was approximately 7-8 feet tall, black and hairey and looked like it had an ape face with its mouth open as he passed by. My brother said it was so big, so unnatural, it was almost traumatizing. The experience was an unforgettable shock to him. He says as he came side by side with the creature he had to force himself to not look at it as he sped past. As I mentioned he would not report this sighting and does not about it in front of his family.

We were on our way back to the cottage and should I say this dirt road we were on runs right through a very dense woodland area that is almost dark in the day time due to the canopy of the trees above road, so at night our line of vision ended as soon as the trees began on the side of the road. Over my friends chatter and occasional laughter  I heard something that sounded rather large following us from behind us to the left, which was the side I was walking on. Whatever that was following us would only move at strategic times when my friends would get a bit too loud or started scraping their feet on the road.  I had the group stop and turn around to face the direction of the noise. One friend got close to me and whispered (removed) look over by that mailbox, and as I turned my head to the left the see what he was talking about I seen a large somewhat illuminated figure slowly walking in a small circle, almost dancing in a way, this really interested me. As soon as the groups attention was focused on the moving figure, I heard a low in volume not threatening grunt. We turned around to see a large pair or red almost orange eyes looking down at us from just within the woods. We stood there and watched it watch us for a few short moments then one friend took off running back to the cabin. As he took off the eyes, still looking directly at me seemed to retreat back into the woods a few yards then got low to the ground continuing to go further and further into the woods.

I had to work on the 18th., so I packed up everything to head home on the afternoon of the 17th. My father and uncle stayed to hunt. I had been on the road maybe a little more than an hour when I decided that it was about time to try to find a place to relieve myself. The area I was in at the time, was mostly forest and not alot around. Then I saw a gravel road to the right and turned on it to get away from the main road. I drove down this road a few hundred yards, stopped the car,shut it off, and jumped out to take care of business. By this time, it was just starting to get dark. Looking up this gravel road, I was facing west. Behind me the sky getting pretty dark, but looking to the west the sky still had alot of light. The road went up a steep hill ahead and had forest on both sides of the road. I was standing in the middle of the road \"taking care of business\" and heard a loud screech that immediatly took my eyes to the top of the hill in front of me. I've spent alot of time outdoors and have never heard a sound like that. At the top of the hill, about a hundred yards away, I could see, what looked like, the silhouette of a person on the left edge of the road (very easy to see because the sky was so much lighter to the west). At this point, I thought that the figure on the hill was probably a hunter that just walked out of the woods from hunting. I finished my \"business\", zipped up, jumped in my car, started it, turned on my lights, and started driving down the road to find a place to turn around. When my lights hit the figure in the road, it was making it's way across to the right side of the road. It was dark in color, was totally covered in hair, and wasn't carrying a gun. I was within about 20 or 30 yards away when it disappeared into the trees on the right side of the road. I estimate a height of 6-7 ft. tall. I did not look for tracks. At the time I was a bit freaked out. I drove down the road about a half mile before turning around, then when I went past the spot that he went in to the woods, I was traveling about 60 mph. The one thing that really convinced me that it was real was watching it walk. It wasn't like an ape and it wasn't like a man, but it was definatly animal-like. All the movements were animal-like. I am totally convinced it was not a person in a suit. 100% sure. I'm not really sure how to discribe what I mean by animal-like movements, but I am sure, 100%, that no person could reproduce movements like that. Also, it wouldn't be a really smart thing to put on a fur suit and go walking through the woods right before dark, on the third day of Michigan's whitetail firearm season. My experience took place just off M-33 between Rose City and I-75. I don't know if there have been other sightings in Michigan, but I am sure that they're here. I haven't told alot of people this story. When it happened, it was a big joke to everyone I told. Now, I'm starting to hear about more and more sightings all over the place. I've seen programs on the Discovery channel and articles in magizines. I know that there are people making a serious attempt to find this creature. Let me reassure anyone looking for it, your not wasting your time, it does exhist. Science is discovering new creatures all the time. In fact I read somewhere about a recent discovery of two previously unknown mammels in N. Vietnam (I think it was N. Vietnam).",

I had walked into the area from the south and stopped to \"let the forest quiet\". I watched as three female deer crossed my path about 75 yards north of me. They were stopping and looking back to the west as they moved to the east. I thought that a buck would be sure to follow. What I saw was a figure that walked silently through the woods. It seemed to be a very large man in a fur coat. I thought,what a fool to be out in the woods in a fur coat and no hunter's orange during deer season! I had on an orange hunting coat and hat. As I stood up, the \"man\" turned to face me. It was then that I realized that this may not be a man. It turned and ran in the direction that it had come. I could not believe how quiet it ran through the woods. I have been hunting for over 50 years and have spent many days in the wilderness at a time but I have never seen such an animal. I have never seen any large animal move so quietly. I have hunted bear, moose, whitetail deer, wild boar, and moose. Never had any of these animals moved through the woods without making a sound. In fact, I had heard the three deer well before I saw them. When I got back to camp, I mentioned this incident to a guy that has hunted the area for decades. I only told him that I saw a guy in a fur coat. He seemed to be a little concerned about going back to the area. I have not hunted that area again. This animal was about 6'8\", had a grey/brown hair and seemed to have arms that were longer than a human's. It walked upright but not as a man would and not as a chimp or other primate that I know of would. There seemed to be white hair around the face and on the chest. The more that I think about it, I am convinced that it was trailing/hunting those deer. It was the rut and those does would be in heat. This could have masked my presence.",

Me and my sister were down at the bus stop, no one ever travels our road. We were getting bored not knowing school was canceled, sun still not up, we smelled something foul. I figured it to be a bear since they were common. About 10 minutes later we heard cracking branches and I assured my sister. About five minutes later a large figure knocked a small dead tree over and chased me and my sister.  I made it in the door of my house and watched it keep running straight in to the trees. Got my sister inside and my mom had to be late for work every day after that. I still remember the grunts and growls and still wake me in nightmares at night.

      "OBSERVED": "Since the 1930's my Granddad and father have hunted the area of Michigan around Mio, from mid state to the Mackinaw Bridge and over to Lake Huron.  As I was grew older starting in the 60's, our family often enjoyed camping summers and fall, and archery hunting every fall in the area east of Mio and southeast of McKinley along the Ausable River, and camped near O'Brien Lake. I didn't think about MI until I started researching BF behavior, and remembered the things I heard while hunting.  The two times I remember hearing pounding was in the late 80s. In 1986, the family was camped there and archery hunting in October once again.  My brother, two brother-in-laws, Dad, and I were once again together archery hunting.  We usually spread out around the area pretty well, and were always separated while hunting.  This afternoon, while I was just sitting enjoying the beautiful fall day, I heard what I can only describe as the sound of pounding of wood on a tree a ways off into the deeper woods.  My first thought was who would be cutting down a tree way out there because they would have several miles to drag it back.  But then as I listened, I noticed something was missing; the familiar metallic ka'ching, ka'ching of an axe on wood was not present.  This was definitely the sound like a branch of piece of wood was being rapped on the side of a tree.  The beating lasted about 5 minutes, then stopped and I didn't hear it anymore.  I didn't really think anymore about it after that but never forgot it either.  Nothing else out of the ordinary occurred that year. I had been successful getting my first really trophy buck in 1986, so was excited to go up again in 1987, with the family and my brother to once again archery hunt.  However we were all disappointed once we arrived at our favorite spots.  The forest sevice had clear cut a huge holding right where we usually hunted.  So we moved back closer and hunted along the Ausable River.  We hadn't been hunting there for a couple of reasons, one of which was it was harder to hunt the swamp around O'Brien Lake and the fact that we had seen bear tracks there alot.  But as the clear cutting had moved us, we planned our strategy and liking ambush areas.  One morning my brother and I walked in the center of a section of mixed hardwoods and pines and sat.  He and I sat about 75 or 100 yds apart.  Later towards lunch time, I heard the tree knocking to the west of us, again no metallic kaching, just wood on wood, then about 15 minutes later a pine tree to the west of me about 40 to 50 yds away started shaking violently.  The entire tree, not just branches but the whole tree.  The tree was about 4 inches in diameter and about 20 feet tall.  At first I thought it a bear, but as I watched it went from side to side almost touching the ground on each side then shook like something was 'wringing' its neck.  Bucks will rub on trees but only a few branches move.  Bear have 'leaned' on trees and pushed on them but I never saw where they could grab hold of a tree and just shake it.  As I was getting hungry for lunch, I decided to start walking out not too long after that; also I didn't want to meet whatever could do this to a tree.  My brother came out and met me not long after I started walking out.  I didn't notice any odors, nor could I make out any animal shapes in the patchwork of shadows and bright sun.  I didn't think anything about it again until this year because as I was stationed near Dayton OH, and now live here, I've definitely seen two Bigfoot here in Ohio and heard another, and without a doubt they are the most exciting thing in your life once you see one, and scary too.  I thought Whitetails were the most exciting thing, but not anymore.  I still hunt though but now I know what to recognize and to keep looking over my shoulder when everything goes quiet or the beating happens. ",

I still have a hard time believing it myself and the few people I've told have made so much fun of it that it makes it even harder for me to believe. I will start with a little background. We live in the southern part of Michigan but my husbands family has a cabin in the northern part near a town called Mio. After three years of visiting Mio and nearby towns I still dont have my bearings when there,so I cant supply any north,south, east or west directions but if you need any my husband knows the area well because hes been going there since he was a small child. I do know a few names of roads though. This is hard for me to explain but when I saw \"bigfoot\" I totally dismissed the idea from my head until a few weeks ago. I would even go so far as to say that I forgot about it. Until recently when I was trying to think of interesting things to search for on the web. For some reason I thought of \"bigfoot\" and happened upon this site. While reading some of the sighting reports I kept seeing this image in my mind and I would think to myself \"now where have I seen this?\" Although I have seen shows on TV about bigfoot I still could not recall seeing my image. Then it came back to me.  We were up north for the weekend with friends and we were planning on doing some riding. There are many offroad trails where it is legal to ride ATV's with an ORV sticker. \"Not allowed in southern MI\" Well anyway, my girlfriend and I went to town to get some things to cook for breakfast and since we were in town we thought we would go to a popular ORV spot on the opposite side of town called \"Bull Gap\". There is a huge hill that is really sandy that everyone rides their ATV's and Trucks up just to see if they can do it, I guess. And there are many trails also connected to bullgap. It is stateland. Well we just wanted to see what was going on so we drove there and didnt really stay just drove back there and looked and then headed back towards town on M? 72. We were driving along on the paved 72 just talking about what I dont remember. When we came around a curve I saw a bigfoot step into the treeline. I immediately interrupted my friend and asked \"Did you see that?\" she said \"What did you see a deer?\" I said \"no it was big and black\" She said it was probably a bear. I kinda snorted and my mind thought that sure as hell was not a bear. I slowed down where I seen the bigfoot enter the woods and told her to look into the trees because thats where I saw it and we both looked and saw nothing. There was no trail and not even a space in the foliage where it must of entered. It was extremely thick, which made me wonder how it fit through there without making a path or something. I did not state that I thought it was a bigfoot because even saying it in my head sounded really stupid to me. I guess I would have been embarrassed. Instead I totally dismissed it from my brain until recently.  You have to understand that although I had always believed there could be a bigfoot I never imagined I would see one and in my native Michigan no less! I had thought they inhabitted only mountainous areas. After reading your sightings reports though I have went back and reflected on what I saw. Never did I doubt that it was a bigfoot I thought that I had been imagining it or something. Truthfully, I had not even thought about it at all from minutes after it happened until recently. That seems strange even to me but I rationalize it by thinking that I saw something that my mind simply couldnt comprehend so it just dismissed it. I will now tell you in as much detail as possible what I saw and how I interpreted it. It was definitely a bigfoot and if not,then it was a dream. I only saw it for a split second as it took one last big step and was gone into the trees. I am not good at judging distances but I guess it would have been about 25 to 30 yards away. I judge its height by the trees that it stepped into and I would guess that anywhere from 10 to 12 feet. It was truly the biggest manshaped thing I've ever seen ( It would have blown away the biggest of WWF wrestlers!) I must tell you that I dont have the greatest eyesight so although It was covered in hair,I didnt see the detail of hairs. It looked just about exactly like the Patterson film bigfoot. I did not get a view of the face. I just saw the outline of the body. It was broad daylight,around 9:00 AM. The head was smoothly rounded(Which makes me think the hair was so long that it laid down flat,not short and distorting the shape of the head.) The shoulders were so broad that it couldnt possibly have been a human it had long legs. It was completely black from head to foot(a very solid black). Even from a distance and with my poor eyesight it still seemed massively huge. Ive never seen anything as big (I cant seem to emphasize this enough). I have totally ruled out a bear(I knew that instantly) my husband tried to convince me of this,saying that bears sometimes stand on hind legs to get a better view,but if that were true then it couldnt have stepped like that into the trees. The shoulders stayed level as it stepped into treeline and besides bears dont have that long of legs. Aside from head,shoulders,and legs I also saw the rounded shape of its buttocks. I have also ruled out a human,even in a suit because of the size of it and the distinctness of its outline. It appeared to me to have a very firm body. I think this bigfoot could possibly hear my truck coming and was trying to get across road before I came around the corner,which it did. If my eyes would not have been positioned exactly where it entered woods I would have missed the split second view as my friend did. The side of the road it was coming from is where there are plenty of riding trails and I thought maybe since people were starting to show up and ride that it went to the other side of the road to get away from all the riders. I have since asked my husband if there were any riding trails on the side of road it went into and he said maybe a few but not sure. It could be protected state land where you are not allowed to ride and he also said that he thinks it is swampy on that side. I plan on investigating further on the next trip up north. I will ask the locals if they have ever seen anything and I would like to go back and check out area it travelled into to get a closer look and judge its size better. I did not stop and get out or anything. I have no desire to have a close encounter with something as big as the bigfoot I saw.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "This I think is also unusual. I dont recall if this is same trip or not(we go several times a year)but on this occasion we went on a canoe trip, there were 5 adults and 5 kids. We pulled off river and climbed a steep embankment to heed mother natures call. The adults were standing around talking when we heard the very loud noise. It is very hard to describe it but it sounded like a mix between a loud squawk of a parrot mixed with kind of a bobcat growl. It echoed along the river and lasted about 3-5 sec.everyone looked at each other and said what the hell was that? I've never heard anything like it. My husband said it was probably a cat (like bobcat) and  two other guys said it didnt sound like any cat they've ever heard. We brought up that it might be a mountain lion since not long before that there was a report that there was one in the area and it supposedly peeled the skin back on a horses face.(horsefarm located right next to cabin,scary thought).  Since reading these reports I had asked husband(since he is an avid hunter and done plenty of it up there) if he's ever heard,smelled or seen anything strange in woods. He said he has smelled horrible smell on several occasions but thought nothing of it since was raised being taught that bear smelled bad and he has heard strange noises like screech owls or something. It seems that once when we were out  riding around in truck (we do that often to see deer,possoms,bear,coyotes,any wildlife that we happen upon) we went to a very remote lake,with no houses or anything around,you have to drive two-tracks to get to it. well I cant recall for sure but I remember seeing bare foot prints in muck and I thought \"who would walk barefoot in this stuff?\" Did not think it was bigfoot but who knows? I will pay much more attention now!",

      "OBSERVED": "Back in 1992 I was bear hunting with a buddy of mine in the area around the town of Lewiston. We had 4 bear bait sites in about a 30 mile radius. One of the sites was located in Red Oak Township. Every time we would go to this site I had this strange feeling like I was being watched or something. It was spooky. One day just before bear season started I was checking this particular bait pile alone. There was a two track road that wound through the woods up a hill and then down to a swamp. The two track ended at a trail which I would park at the head of and then walk down with two 5 gallon buckets of bear bait which usually consisted of meat scraps and pastries. On this particular day I had just dumped the bait on the bait pile and was walking up the path to my truck. The cover was fairly thick but thined out the closer you came to the two track. I was about 60 yards in from the two track and could see it when something very strange happened. I creature of some sort I would say about 7 to 8 feet tall walked across the two track. This creature crossed the two track in one step. I have seen bears and run across bears in the woods before but I can say for sure this was definitely not a bear. I was so startled that I just stopped in my tracks and said to myself, \"what in the he** was that?\" I walked closer to where the creature crossed I kept getting the overwhelming feeling of fear. When I got to the spot where I thought this creature had crossed I stopped and looked in the direction in which the creature had walked looked. about 30 feet or so behind a large cedar tree I could make out what appeared to be a a face which was defintly not a bear but not a man either. It looked kind of black like a mountain gorilla would. I thought I was seeing things so I kind of blinked a few times but it was still there after about 15 seconds the creature turned away from me and disappeared into the woods. All the time this was happening I just could not shake this feeling of dread or doom. I have hunted and fished all over the state of Michigan and have never been afraid of anything that I have encountered but this really shook me. I can best describe the creature as about 7 to 8 feet tall very dark in color and like I stated previously had a face that looked like a cross between a man and a gorilla. I have never seen anything that even came close to this. Up until now I was a non-believer in Bigfoot. I always figured that what people were seeing was bears walking on there back legs. This was NOT a bear and it was not a man either. I never told anyone about this for years. I did not think anyone would believe me and I did not want to listen to my hunting buddies tease me about it.",

      "OBSERVED": "Im 41 and have hunted this area in Northern Michigan a lot, First let me begin with what I have seen several times in an area That I have Bird hunted 100s of times.. For years I have hunted grouse along a cedar swamp that runs along a farmers field, there is a spot where i have found numerous bones and some kind of scat, I thought it was a coyote that was feeding on the farmers cows or an area were a coyote would drag deer( I'm not sure what kind of bones but they looked like cow or deer) The grouse would often flush from the trees so I just figured a coyote or bear was in the area a lot.. the area is a straight shot and it runs about 2 miles and has alot of downed trees and is really an ankle break type of hunt lots of stumps and holes where tress have been uprooted.. Last week while hunting I noticed what I thought was a dead bear about 30 yards to my right( I only looked in that direction because of very foul odor), it was hairy and just laying there, it looked out of place and had no movement . the area I hunt is very moist and soft so you can be very quiet.. Just to make sure it wasn't a wounded bear I grabbed a fallen tree limb and started hitting a tree. what ever this was looked in my direction and jumped to its feet( it was standing upright) it really got up in a hurry and made a quick exit and it was running upright away from me. . the noise it made running through the woods was a very loud crashing so I knew it was a very large animal.. after the sighting I went over to where it was laying and noticed a large bedding area that had ground dug up and a fallen tree to the east of the bed or resting area .. it was the last day of my hunt I took a few pictures with my camera phone but the images didnt come out very clear.. My next trip up to that area is in 10 days so I plan on taking more quality pictures.. Im not sure what I saw it could have been a wounded bear that was hit with an arrow that couldn't use its front legs( I didn't see any blood) but it was upright and it looked like a \" Bigfoot\" .. I'm still a little shook up about the whole thing and I'm embarrassed to tell anyone.. My gut tells me it was not a bear my head tells me it wasnt a \"bigfoot\" sorry if this story isnt what your looking for.. I wrote this story about a month ago and was embarrassed to submit it, The more I thought about what I saw the more I can remember looking at it and expecting to see a bear  ,it was puzzling to expect to see a bear and then you see something you cant explain .. Ive asked myself a 1000 times could this have been a bear, maybe it hurt its front legs and was forced to try to escape on its hind legs..  But it moved to fast and navigated around tress to easy for it to be a wounded bear..  then when It looked at me I expected to see a long face of a bear but it wasn’t .. The one thing I noticed more then anything is it had a very large rear end.. I haven't been back but when I do go back  I will take pictures of the area..  still kind of shook up about the whole experience and I try to relive the encounter over and over again in my mind..  I haven't told anyone and I doubt I will, its a very big part of my life now and seriously has put me in a very bad state of mind with many questions.  I planned on going back up to the area the following weeks but have not...",

      "OBSERVED": "I had went for the evening to relax in the nearby harbor (Presque Isle) to have dinner and then drove up to the New Presque Isle Lighthouse and parked my car.  I walked thru a clearing of trees (east) from the lighthouse towards Lake Huron.  It was a full-moon, clear night with very little waves on the lake.  I had been at this location for around :30 minutes to about :45 minutes and had been wading out in the water to just cool off.  I was in shorts/t-shirt and flip-flops as it was summer.  After I decided that it was time to leave I started to go back towards my car and subsequently dry off.  As I was walking back thru the same clearing that I had come from earlier I could hear some motion in the trees to my left.  I remember also it was very still/quiet that night while on foot.  At different times I heard what sounded like large (or fairly large) twigs snapping on or near the ground and thought maybe it was a deer of some sort, probably not a bear I didn't think. Sometimes it would be one or two twigs/branches snapping, other times it was multiple snaps which would occur quite quickly as if perhaps (at the time) whatever it was had some good size weight to itself. I had the distinct impression (or sense) that I was being watched and it made me feel quite un-easy, I had a more sense of urgency at this point of just wanting to get to my car and leave.  Also at other times I heard what sounded like whole trees being moved or pushed somewhat out of the way, I was puzzled as it implied to me that something was off in the trees that had a fairly good size body mass.  As I continued on towards the end of the clearing, the sound would parallel (or stay) with me--it wasn't getting distant or going away from my vantage point of where I first starting hearing the commotion going on.  After I had gotten into my car I felt hugely relieved but couldn't still necessarily understand why.  I remember too, that I was constantly looking around \"over my shoulder\" very intently but figured it was more than likely a small animal and no big deal.  As I drove off (about maybe--?  50-100 yards) as I had already turned on the radio and was feeling pretty relaxed I noticed from off the left side of my car (from the headlights shining onto some of the trees and roadway) a large black, furry looking figure standing completely in the front of the tree line looking dead, straight at me with some powerful--menacing eyes.  (The eyes followed me as I went past).  It completely shocked me, I slammed on the brakes of my car and just sat in the middle of the road for around half a minute (or less) and was trying to figure out (rationalize/take in) what I had just seen.  It stood around I would say between 7'-8' feet tall and it's arms were unusually long.  More than anything, the face is what spooked me and I remember the most as it closely resembled that of a man--the nose was flat and it stood completely erect, was not slouched or bent over--exactly still.  The head looked like it was just perched onto some huge shoulders, the shoulders were massive going across and the upper torso was quite impressive.  I decided it would be best to just keep going as I had thought about of maybe turning the car around and shine my high beam lights into the tree line (to see if I could spot it again) but decided this probably would not be in my best interest.  I went on and headed back to Alpena where I had come from originally.  I was never so glad to see \"city lights\" again until I reached the north end of town while on U.S.-23.  I told no one what I had seen, actually for a long time.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "Quite massive, tall--very well built.  Eyes were piercing and looked like they meant business.  Hair on the face looked flat, or groomed like appearance.  Whole body covered in hair, black fur like that of bears common to northern-lower Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.  Arms quite long, down to or past the knee-caps. A night that will live with me forever, it's very vivid in my mind.  I was in total un-belief when I first saw it.  I don't look at the woods now in quite the same light as I did before this occurence. Last year in April ('07) I went with a friend of mine that shares a similar interest with bigfoot sightings (but has never seen one)--him and I went back up to this location (I live 3 hours away) and went into the wooded area where I originally heard the sounds from that night.  Other than possible wind damage from storms off of Lake Huron, etc., - the area back in there (we walked around 200-300' feet in from off of the clearing path) we saw numerous trees that looked like as \"if\" at one time or another, had been pushed over.  In particular one tree (about 30' feet long) with a trunk diameter of 12\" inches or more had been bent over above my waist level and I am 6'ft/1\" in-- tall.  The wood was fairly fresh and splintered all thru it, but not completely broken off.  \"Whatever\" it could have been that did that, had to have Had some enormous strength--at least I thought so.  Parts of it in there looked (somewhat) like a Mess!  I told my friend that I felt like I was walking around in someone else's domain, like we didn't necessarily belong there.  We walked a parallel course that I had thought perhaps it took that night, from hearing it in the trees to where it stood along the road (in the tree line).  It took us at least :15 minutes to walk to where we came out to the tree line, the underbrush and trees were quite thick.  -IF- the creature also went this way (or similar to it) It had to have went thru these trees (underbrush, etc) like \"nothing\"..

One evening a southbound freighter on Lake Huron had reported her light (up in the lighthouse) as being on and knew that it was supposed to have been de-activated long ago.  They reported the incident to the U.S. Coast Guard who in turn reported it to the harbor master.

He slammed on his brakes and this large animal on 2 legs bent at the waist looked right at us, 3 to 4ft. away. I was close enough to see the pupil and its eyes were bloodshot. Small head not a bear. Long brown matted hair with a blond tint here and there. As it went by watching us, I felt it was scared. I continued to watch and it was bent at the waist and it hip was level with my vision in van. This all happened very quick, 4 to 5 steps and it cleared the road. Another car was comming at us and went into the ditch. We drove on about 2 min. and I said to my friend, Did you see something back there and he stoped the van and said I didn't want to say anything, I asked him tell me what you seen and I was not crazy either.

      "OBSERVED": "At the time of the incident I was 15 years old and had spent my entire life in the woods.  I knew what was out there and how to identify it.  It was about 3:00pm and I was walking home from school through the woods.  As I was walking I had an uneasy feeling and started to look around at my surroundings.  I eventually dismissed my feeling and chalked it up to my mind playing tricks on me.  I continued on my walk, with my head down, not thinking anything more about my uneasy feeling.  I happened to glance up and notice \"someone\" standing in the trail ahead of me (about 70 - 80 yards.)  I originally dismissed the person due to the fact it was common practice for some people to get out of school and smoke cigarettes or dope in that area.  I concluded that what I saw was a person partaking in one of those practices. Something was nagging at me that the person I saw didn't seem right...the spot where the individual was standing was where the swamp meets the trail.  No body went that far in to smoke.  As I looked up, I froze.  I had an unexplainable fear come over me.  I have seen deer, bear, bobcat, and cougars in this peticular piece of land and have never been scared.  What I saw before me was none of those.  The creature in front of me was all one uniform color, either dark brown or black.  It's arms extended down almost to it's knees, and it's shoulders were very wide.  In addition, it was standing on two legs and kinda peering at me from around a tree (it would later move into the trail.) Even though I could not move or yell, my mind was still working.  I did what I could to burn an image of this creature in my mind.  I remember thinking that the head looked too small for the body, and that I could not see any skin tone on the face.  It was as if the skin was the same color as the rest of the body.  The last thing I did was notice a branch above the creatures head.  I noted that the branch was only a couple of inches above the creatures head. I looked at this animal for a minute or less when it pivoted on it's back foot, took one stride into the swamp, and then disappeared.  After ten minutes the paralyzed feeling left me and I returned to normal.  At that point I decided to investigate.  I walked up to the spot where it had stood and looked for any indication of something being there.  The ground at this spot was very hard; no tracks were visible.  The stride of this creature was at least five feet.  As I mentioned earlier, the creature was originally peering at me from behind a tree, but came out into the trail.  I estimated from where the creature stood to where I last saw it on the edge of the trail/swamp was about five feet.  It only took one step and it was out of sight.  Now, I am about six foot tall and have a three foot stride...what ever I saw would have to be considerably larger than me.  With this in mind, I also looked for the tree branch that the beast was standing under.  I found it right above my head, indicating I was indeed at the right location.  The branch was about nine feet high.  Whatever I saw was just shy of nine feet tall. To this day I have no difinitive proof of what I saw to be a Bigfoot.  However, I don't know what else to call it.  The specific location, on the edge of the swamp, was not frequented by people, the creature's body structure was not that of a human, and lastly the creature was much too large to be a human.  As of this writing I have not had any other incidents in that location, though I have had a strange encounter in another part of Northern Michigan.  I don't feel that the creature would have harmed me, but I very rarely go into that area of the woods by myself.",

It was light out with a light rain. We were coming up over a ridge on the trail and when we were starting down a huge bigfoot ran across the trail in front of us. We all saw it well. It was covered in long black hair with a patch of white hair along its back near its shoulder. Its was running with amazing speed in a forward leaning position and its arms seemed to almost touch the ground as it ran we figured it to be approximately 9 foot tall. We could clearly see legs arms hands head muscle definition throughout its body even with long hair. The hair on its back and body was longer than the hair on its head and arms. We didnt get to see its face tho.but the strangest part of this was that it was running with a gray colored wolf that I've seen multiple times before. It really appeared that they were together..The wolf was at full stride about 15 feet behind it .Once it cleared the track it went up the hill on the other side with an amazing speed. It seemed to pull away from the wolf at the last little bit we watched it. We tried to drive to where they last were to try and see them again but they were gone. That wolf was ran very close to me on my 4 wheeler and I can tell you he is no little puppy. He leaves an almost 5 1/2 inch track and the bigfoot dwarfed the wolf. The next day I went back to look for prints but the 14 hours of heavy rain over night ruined and prints there might have been. We have found several other 4 toed very large prints in the area. A local bf researcher came out to investigate the area and was impressed with what is called tree structures. There was are a couple found like a teepee style and one is very large but the trees are upside down. Weird!

      "OBSERVED": "My sighting occurred over twenty years ago, in the fall of 1978, so I don't know if this will be helpful to anyone or not.  I was driving on highway U.S. 2 across Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which skirts the northernmost shores of Lake Michigan.  I had been been driving with my 18-month-old son in the car seat next to me, all day from Minneapolis towards St. Ignace,Mich. and had grown sleepy. So I stopped at a roadside picnic area about 20 miles east (maybe more) of Manistique, Michigan on the edge of the Hiawatha National Forest.  The picnic area contained only one picnic table and a trash receptacle, very rustic, and was surrounded by deep woods. I locked my doors (driving a Saab station wagon) checked the baby and fell asleep in the driver's seat, figuring to catch a cat nap and drive the last 100 miles or so afterward, it was about ten or eleven p.m. when I fell asleep. After only a short time, maybe two hours, I was awakened by a HORRIBLE smell, like nothing I'd ever smelled before, and I remember thinking the baby must be sick to have filled his diaper with such a rotten odor.  So I turned on my interior light and grabbed the diaper bag from the back seat, but when I checked my son's diaper, it was clean !!  He was awake and staring out the windshield (carseats didn't have to face ackwards, back then) and I followed his gaze . . . At first glance I got scared, thinking a large bear was standing on its hind legs directly in front of my car, but when I turned on the headlights, thinking this would scare the bear away, I could tell this was no bear.  I can't say how tall it was but it seemed to tower over the small car, bending forward at the waist and the lights didn't faze it at all.  It was only three or four feet away from us, leaning over the hood and staring into the car through the windshield. The creature was covered in very dark brown, long hair but it had no snout like a bear would have - rather, it had a flat face and a nose that kind of looked negroid (is that a politically correct description ?)  and I focused on the face (so almost human) so I can't describe the body.  The eyes were large, round, brown and bright but seemed to be set in the middle of the head.  By that I mean the face was centered in the large head, with no hair on the cheeks, nose or around the mouth.  The creature did not move or make a sound, but seemed to be in a staring match with my son even though the night had been very dark before I turned on all the lights !! Even though the encounter lasted only a few minutes, I was frightened out of my wits but my instincts served me and I started the car, slammed it into reverse and hit the peddle hard. I didn't look back as I sped away east with a thumping heart.  I didn't even talk about this incident for several months, thinking no one would believe me and I may have dreamed it all - but the memory has never faded and I've never dreamed of strong smells before or since.  Over the next few years, I spoke with several people in the U.P. who have also sighted Sasquatch near or in the Hiawatha National Forest, but unfortunately cannot name them.",

I would take the Manistique river road to work every day to try and bag a couple of partridge on the way in.  This is a gravel road that runs along the river from Germfask to Manistique.  On this day, I left early and drove slowly for about the first half of the road.  I had shot one bird, and chased another into the popples a way, and realized that I was close to being late. I cased up my shotgun and jumped in the car and put the hammer down in the 1991 Ford Fiesta.  About 45mph is pretty fast on this road, but I had driven it many times.  With the river on the right and white pine stands on the left, I was approaching an area called the \"second high bank.\"  I saw movement on the left in the pines, and slowed down thinking to avoid hitting a deer. About 30 to 40 yards ahead of me I saw what can only be described as a sasquatch approach the road, then pause and look in my direction, and apparently, change his mind and turn and run parallel to the road in the direction I was travelling.  This scared the s*** out of me.  I slowed down but was scared to stop, and I didn't want it to jump me in the small car, so I jammed brakes, and reversed a couple hundred yards.  I took my single shot 20 ga. out of the case and loaded it with birdshot.  Still scared to go back in the direction I was headed, I sat there for about 2 to 3 minutes, until a pickup truck with another hunter approached from the same direction I had come.  I let him pass and then followed him on through to Manistique.  As I passed the area where the sasquatch had been I looked for sign, but saw none.

The path we would always take was Gulliver lake road ( I believe) next to the lake that looped back to our fathers cabin. Next to the lake was a wooded area that went uphill then on the other side was large sand dune. We went out later than usual so it was completly dark outside, a moonless night save a few lightpoles. As we passed the lake and made left to the other side of the wooded area where the dunes were my sister heard something but at the time she did not say anything. As we kept walking my sister would say to me that something was following us on our left side behind the treeline. We stopped to listen I thought i heard something move but was not sure. As we started to leave the wooded area behind us we both clearly heard a grunt 20 feet behind us. It sounded like a  \" ooogghh\" or \"uuugghh\". I swear it sounded as if it tellin us to get out of its territorry.",

It sounded exactly like the calls from your website. Then again this June 2007 we were up there again and there was another sound that was loud and it sounded like muffled talking.  It sounded like something was trying to talk but not using English words.  We were both pretty startled. Then that same trip we went searching for a particular lake in Schoolcraft county, we found it and went down a road marked site 2.  I was looking around and my husband was fishing down at the lake.  He called me down there and there was a very large human shaped foot print where the sand met the grassy area.  I put my foot in the track and it fit but it was just much bigger.

There is a lot of country past Green Lake up into the Hickey Marsh and eventually the Seney. I had noticed partridge remains where we parked. I didn't think about. The hounds were gamey right out of the box. I cut a young hound and proven hound in. Both with a lot of grit. When they struck I had the feeling we weren't running coon but rather a bobcat. It took about twenty minutes and they treed. We proceeded into the dogs and right before the tree the critter bailed. Cats bail when they see lights like bear do at night when we run them. The dogs pulled tree and gave chase again. Treeing deeper. Way deeper. My son-in-law went to the truck to holler me out if needed. I kept the the tracker with me. I'm now in marsh with a mixture of spruce, cedar, bog and popple. The dogs treed deep. I went to a high spot to vantage my hearing on them. A thick wooded ridge. My radio tracker could barely read them and barely read the extra collar at the truck. Its range in wooded areas is about 7 miles. I kept swinging it around slowly trying to gain a good reading. I could smell something foul but thought it was myself after falling in swamp muck on more than one occasion. Again while swinging my tracker my coonlight in the direction of the antenna I noticed in the spruce a set of eyes next to the deer run on this ridge. Coon hunting you see a lot of different eye shine. I shrugged and swung the tracker, when I swung back into the trail toward the truck the trail was filled with animal twenty feet in front of me. It was around 8 feet tall long arms with fingers, barrel chested and pot bellied. The eyes were close and deep set but aggressive in its gaze, the mouth was agap. My goodness the ears were small. I froze in my tracks, I lost my training of the hounds call. We just looked at each other frozen. It grabbed a very large spruce, wrapping its hand around it. Its hair was black to brown not long, not short, the nose flat, with a face not covered in hair like its body. I really don't remember how it left. I remember the smell followed me almost all the way to the truck just up a trail where my son-in-law met me. He commented I passed gas jokingly. I was very shaken. I had a hard time reading my tracking system on the way back, I doubted my compass. It wasn't the straightest path back. To this day I haven't ran the hounds up there for or or bear since. As well it was the only time I left my hounds in the woods. In the morning after sleeping a bit I rode up {nervous as hell } to try and find the hounds by myself as my son in law went to work. Thank the lord they were treed in the beechwoods 30 feet off the gravel road with the prettiest sleeping bobcat you ever seen in the tree.",

      "OBSERVED": "Newspaper article : Idaho Statesman (Boise); November 22, 1981 BIGFOOT BLAMED FOR TROUBLE NEAR EAST MICHIGAN TOWN Yale, Mich. (UPI) - Cindy Barone says it's not the torn- down fences of the barn doors that have been ripped off at the hinges, nor is it the high-pitched screaming her family often hears at night. \"It's the unknown that scares us,\" she said. \"If I knew what it was I could deal with it.\" The rural St. Clair County woman is referring to a large, hairy creature that she and her family are convinced is a Sasquatch, or Bigfoot - a creature that is said to walk on two legs and roam wooded areas from Maine to Washington. While there is no documented proof of the existence of Bigfoot, films have been made that supposedly show the creature fleeing into a forest. The Barones' latest encounter with the beast came Friday evening at their east Michigan farm, when daughters Tina, 13 and Roxanne, 12, went out to the barn to check on their animals. Tina said the horses were spooked and when she reached for the light switch in the pitch-black barn she felt some fur. \"At first I thought it was a goat or something, so I took my glove off and I touched it again,\" she said. But she said the beast stood two feet above her, glaring down with bright red eyes. Tina said she didn't know what the animal was. \"I have no idea,\" she said. \"All I know is that its fur was about one inch thick and all matted and dirty.\" Wayne King, the founder and head of the Michigan-Canadian Bigfoot Information Center, said this is the first report in which a human has made physical contact with a Sasquatch. Mrs. barone, 33, said the family's first encounter with the animal came in September. Since then fences have been torn down a number of times and animals spook frequently, she said. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Detroit News-Sunday, November 22, 1981 Hairy, red-eyed A ‘BIGFOOT' IN THUMB? BY Ann Cohen News Staff Writer Cindy Barone isn't sure she wants to call the creature, \"Bigfoot.\" But something big, hairy and red -eyed has frightened her family three times since September. Something out there roaming the farm fields of Michigan's Thumb area is emitting high-pitched screams by night. \"It's the unknown that scares us,\" says Mrs. Barone, whose family last encountered the creature Friday night at their farm home near Yale in St. Clair County. Tina Barone, 13, said she and her sister, Roxanne, 12, went to the barn to do chores. \"Roxanne was scared to go into the barn because she'd heard noises before,\" Tina said. \"I said I would go in first, so I reached in for the light. \"I felt fur. \"At first I thought it was a goat or something, so I took my glove off and I touched it again. \"It didn't look like anything. It was tall with red eyes and big and black and furry and stood on two legs. It had a deep growl.\" Tina told Roxanne to run back to the house. \"It scared me so bad I just had to run.\" Roxanne said. \"I just can't put what it looked like into any kind of form.\" Tina said she turned and began to walk slowly from the barn but \"it started walking out behind me and I started running.\" The creature never tried to harm her, Tina said. \"It let me touch him when I took my glove off, \" she said. \"The horses were running around, they were spooked. But it was just curious, whatever it is.\" The girl's cousin David, 18, got his 16-gauge shotgun to scare the creature away. \"When it stood there and looked at me, it didn't know what to do and I didn't either,\" said Barone. \"It's unbelievable.  Its big. \"It was some kind of animal but I can't describe what. It was about 6 feet; 6 or 7 feet 6. I didn't shoot to kill, I just shot in the air to scare it away. It ran into the woods, making a funny noise. \"It was standing on two feet and had real long arms-between a bear and an ape, that's what I think.  I've never seen a Bigfoot, so I have no idea if it was one of those.\" Mrs. Barone, 33, said their first encounter with the animal came in September, when her neighbors' barn door was ripped off at the hinges. \"I've had fences torn down and grain barrels dumped over and eaten,\" she said.  She said her dogs have raced off into the dark, barking at an unknown intruder, and their farm animals have been spooked by some unknown predator many times. Mrs. Barone said the family is frustrated by the unwillingness of many people, including the local sheriff to take her story seriously. Mrs. Barone did file a report of the Friday incident with the sheriff's department but the report contains no mention of her daughter actually seeing an animal. \"There was nothing in our report to indicate this,\" said a department spokeswoman, who speculated that Tina actually felt a raccoon or other small, friendly creature. But Tina is sure she did not feel a typical barnyard animal.  \"From now on, I'm going to take the camera when I'm doing barn chores in case I see him again, because no one believes us,\" she said. A mysterious creature- called a Sasquatch, or Bigfoot- that walks on two legs and roams wooded areas from coast to coast has been reported many times from coast to coast. While there is no documented proof of the existence of Bigfoot, films have been made that reportedly show the creature fleeing into a forest and footprints and other evidence have been uncovered which has led many people to believe the creatures do exist. \"I don't know what it is but I do know it is something,\" Mrs. Barone said.",

Myself, sister and 4 other neighbor kids had to walk about 3/4 of a mile from where the school bus dropped us off to our homes, the road was gravel, very few houses and far apart. We had just got dropped off by the bus and were walking home, as I was walking I happened to catch something out of the corner of my eye and turned around to see what it was, as I turned around a creature, that I now know as bigfoot, came up the side of the ditch. It was on all fours until it topped the edge of the ditch. The ditches were very deep probably 6 to 7 feet, and wide. I think it was laying on the side of the slope until we walked past, when it jumped on the road on 2 feet, it took a couple steps across the road, jumped the ditch on the opposite side, took another step or 2, put one hand on a wooden fence leaped over it and ran probably 1000 to 1500 feet across an open field, on two legs, upright. The fence was designed to hold ponies and I can remember I had to grab the upper wooden rail, put my foot on the middle rail and swing my leg on the top rail and climb down the other side. I was 12 so I would say the fence was around 5 foot high. This thing scaled it with ease, we all had a clear view of this beast, it ran across that field faster than the ponies could run. At that time I never heard of a bigfoot. I went home, told my dad what had happened, he went down and looked for tracks, thinking bear. No tracks found as it was mostly sandy ground. I wondered all my life what I had seen. About 20 years ago I seen a TV show about bigfoot and it dawned on me that was what I had seen. My sister can also remember the incident, she was 9. I would like to say this was completely covered with hair, I did not see its face, but it was not 8 or 9 feet tall, my best guess would put it at between 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet tall, I can still to this day see this happening in my memories like it was yesterday, this is probably not important ,been far too many years ago, but I thought I would share this with you anyway.",

She grab their binoculars to get a better look, cos it was walking weird and it seem really tall about 6 ft to 7 ft tall and my dad was trying to get a good look without the binoculars and could tell it didnt look human.

Then  it walked into the woods. They didnt hear anything weird after that. It was already dark.

      "OBSERVED": "I have always wondered about an encounter that I had when I was in eighth grade.  I just recently found your site and for the first time listened to some of the screams you have posted.  For the first time since that night I feel like I heard something similar to what happend that night. I had been out with friends.  We were out running around playing ding dong ditch and had finished with our mischief for the night.  It was probably around 10 or 10:30 and I needed to get home.  I had lived in the area for eight years or so and was very familiar with all of the back trails and ways to get around off of the main, albeit dirt, roads. The area I lived in was a resort carved out of a group of swampy lakes by a developer about twenty years before. It was fairly built up, but with large swaths of forest between many of the homes.  In addition, since many of the homes were used as weekend and summer cottages, the area was sparsly populated from the early fall until the spring. I walked home alone that night and at one point had to make a decision about whether or not to follow the road or go up a path that would cut about ten minutes off of my walk time.  I knew I was running late and cerfew was coming up soon, so I chose to go up the path which ran along a ridge to a low hill about two hundred yards from a swampy lagoon off of one of the main lakes.  I was pretty familiar with this pathway (now a full road ) because I would take it in the daytime with my bike and occasionally stop to pick wild strawberries that grew there in abundance. I vivdly remember stopping at the trailhead trying to see into the woods.  There was no moon and since this area was well away from any light source, it was pitch black.  For some reason I was a little jumpy about walking down the path tonight. I even remember walking about ten yards down the trail and walking back out for some reason.  I figured it wasa just bacuase it was so dark.  I figured I was just being jumpy unnecessarily and walked in. The path was about a quarter of a mile long and at the end ran down a steep hill.  My house was about two hundred yards from the end of the trail and just on the other side of the finger of the lagoon off of the lake.  About three quarters of the way into the trail I walked up on something, I am still not sure what since I could not see anything.  About twenty or thirty feet directly in front of me there was a very loud and piercing scream that made me jump completly out of my skin.  The scream was followed by a loud crashing as whatever it was ran down the hill through the woods towards the lake.  whatever it was covered the distance through the woods in only a couple of seconds and in a very few bounds.  Needless to say I did not stick around and tore off down the trail, down the hill and to my house as fast as I could. I to this day do not know what I encountered.  I still remember the scream and it sound very similar to the sound of a woman's scream.  It was very high piched and ver loud. I have told myself time and time againg that I just walked up on a deer, but the scream did not seem like anything that would have come from a deer.  I'd love your opinion on what it is I ran across.  I don't know what happend that night.",

      "OBSERVED": "I had reported earlier (Michigan Report #808) about sightings I had when I was in high school.  In October of 2003, I as home on leave from Korea (I'm an officer in the Army, currently a Lieutenant Colonel, but at the time of this report I am submitting, a Captain).  My dad and I were planning on doing a lot of bow hunting while I was home and got two areas set up - a bow stand for me and my dad sat in the ground blind he used for rifle season.  The location is near Manistee, Michigan, East of North Custer Rd and North of East Custer Rd.  Over the course of four mornings, we entered the woods approximately one hour before daylight to set in and let things calm down.  The first morning, 11 October 2003, we moved in and split up to our positions.  I was on my stand, settled in, and immediately heard three distinct knocks, from the North of where we were.  Farther North, I heard an answer.  There is a cabin to the West, and I figured it was those guys, as they are usually up on weekends for hunting.  However, the next three mornings, I heard this sound again after we entered the woods, however, the returns changed location, two coming from directly East, and one generally Northeast.  I took this as some sort of signal, but felt it may be the large woodpeckers that are common in the area (except you didn't have the normal rapid drilling/pounding you normally equate to woodpeckers).  However, after seeing \"Finding Bigfoot\" I now equate these to wood knocks that were signalling our presence.  The sounds ceased after the final morning of knocks.  I returned for solo hunts and again with my dad with no repeat of sounds. In October of 2004, I moved my stand East of where I was hunting into the edge of pines and used this to over watch a trail system.  I had gotten into the stand without incident, was set about an hour after first light (0830) when I heard a garbled sound close to the gibberish heard on Bigfoot sounds and running (North in the pines), when a doe bounded through the pines, stopped 10 yards in front of me breathing heavily, and kept staring North of her.  The gibberish and movement kept coming, then it sounded like a quick sound like \"Huh\" then silence.  What I then heard was the sound of similar to something sniffing deeply, and then slow movement towards the Northeast and East of me.  As this began, the doe moved quickly past me to the Southwest, eyes really big.  The sniffing ended, but the movement seemed to remain, slow, deliberate movement, but you could hear twigs snap periodically. For two nights after that incident, while in my stand, I felt I was being watched, and circled, hearing slow movement, especially just before dark, to my Northeast and East, then to the South of me, where whatever it was, seemed to be curious, as I was in a stand and not really seen, had shelled corn off the trail for bait, and it knew I was there, knew something was around, but couldn't see me.  It was too loud for a deer, but big enough to be heard.  I had my stand against a big pine, with a larger pine really masking me. I have pictures of me in the stand after I put it up and can provide those for a reference.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "Post muzzle loader season in Dec 2004, after I officially returned from Korea, we went to that spot to discharge our muzzle loaders.  There was snow, and as we moved into the opening, along the Eastern edge of the pines, were large tracks, single file, that went North-South.

      "OBSERVED": "I was deer hunting in a swamp, back end of the Clay Bank Swamp.  I was by myself and in my favorite spot that I had picked out when I was about 14, I usually go in before daybreak and don't come out until dark, pack a lunch with me.  The day was normal, several does, no bucks. About a half hour before dark I heard a loud scream just off to the north of me, I had never heard a sound like that before in the woods, a minute later a branch was broke off a tree in the same direction, it was not a small branch as it cracked loudly.  At first I just watched closely in that direction wondering what the heck was that?  And then caution set in, as like I said I had never heard anything like that,  I hunt with a Krag 30-40, so I took the safety off and wrapped my thumb around the bolt to prevent accidental discharge and then I was going to wait for dark,  but again caution told me to get out of the swamp,  then butterflies set into my stomach because of the unknown and I had the urge to run,  but I refused as I have been in the woods most of my life hunting and know that running will set off a chase with a predator, so I walked slowly and constantly rubber necking to see if I could see anything, I didn't.  When I got to my car I started the engine, left the door open, set my 357 Smith & Wessen on the roof where I could reach it, set my Krag up there also, took off my coat and put it in the back seat, unloaded the Krag and put it away, all at the time watching where I had come from.  What I did see is this, whatever was in the woods followed me back to my car, I did not see it directly but it was about 35 yds standing behind some heavy swail, I could see the form, it was on two legs, quite broad and about 8 ft tall.  I picked up my 357 got in the car and left, I did not unload the pistol until I was at least a 1/4 mile away.  I also did not hunt in that swamp again for several years.  I hunt there again now as I feel whatever they are (which I believe is a Sasquatch) they are not dangerous.  I do hunt there again now and am unafraid.  This happened in Late November of 62 or 63.",

We were headed for upstate New York. It was approximately two in the morning, I was driving east on Hwy 2, in northern Michigan, I was driving through the Hiawatha National Forest.  I looked down the road and about 3/4 of a mile down, there was something in the road.  I couldn't tell what it was, all that I could see was the reflection of the eyes, a red reflection, I thought nothing of it, thought it was an animal and kept going, I was running at about 80MPH.  As I approached  what I thought was an animal, it didn't move, as I got closer I figured out that it wasn't going to move, I had to slam on the brakes.  Naturally, this created a great deal of blue smoke.  And I still could see the red eyes, they didn't move.  I still could not make out what was in the road.  After the car came to a stop, I looked up after the smoke cleared and there it was, this thing was approximately 11 feet tall, fairly slender, his hands reached down to his knees.  I sat there looking at this thing, and he stood there unruffled, looking back at me.  We stared at each other for approximately a minute and a half.  Then he turned to his left, his head turned, then his entire body turned to his left, and took two steps to the edge of the road and looked back at me.  He was covered in fur, from his head to his feet.  And it was as though his head turned almost all the way around to look back at me.  Then he stepped down into the field on the side of the road, it was about 50 feet to the forest, then when he went up to the edge of the forest, he stopped once again, and did that funny turning of his head to look back at me one more time and then he took one big kind of a side step into the forest, and he was gone. He was about 11 feet tall, covered in dark red short fur with red type highlights, it was clean fur, and somewhat neat and orderly.  His eyes were very unnerving.  He made no sounds.

I right away thought this is unusual as people just do not venture into this marshy area. Now this is the 3rd week of Feb., and that winter we had had a heavy fall of snow, and the depth of the snow in that area was around 30 inches. I was able to sno-mobile as the snow had a very hard crust on the surface solid enough to support the weight of the sno-machine without breaking through. So I drove right up on the trail made by something and I stopped and looked down at them. Then I realized these were not black-bear tracks of one coming out of hibernation early, or some person on snow-shoes, or any other familiar thing. These were human bare-foot tracks. The impression left in the snow by whatever walked through there was perfect. The heel mark, the toes, the way the feet taper from wide in the front to narrow by the heel. And thats when the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. A bare-foot giant had walked through there. I saw those prints, and a real fear came over me. And at that time, I had never heard of bigfoot. I had heard of Yeti, in the Himalayas, and Sasquatch in the Pacific north west, but never Bigfoot. I got out of there in a hurry.",

One day when I was about seven years old I was standing on the hill leading down to the lake when I saw five of them at the edge of the water. I ran to get my parents. I, my father, my mother and younger brother watched the five of them swim over to the little oak woods on the north side of the lake. They had no clothes on and they were hairy. There were three large ones and two small ones. We never saw them again.\" The children were not allowed off the porch for weeks after that, which she remembers very well as not being pleasant. Her parents were German immigants and her father instructed her mother and the children never to tell anyone because people would begin to ridicule them as crazy immigrants. This day was the first time she'd told anyone else about it. My granfather looked at her not like she was crazy but like he was kinda hurt that she had never told him in all the years they were married. In 1992 the population around that area had grown tremendously but the little oak woods was still there intact when I took my children to see it.",

I was around 13 at the time of the incident, the room was long and narrow...roughly 10'L x 20'W, and the window was between me and the door out, so I would have to get across the room and out going past the open window...this took a couple of minutes, as I had to get up the courage to even get out of the bed. Finally, I ran out of the room and told my dad, who was half asleep and half watching TV in the living room, which was on the other end of the house...2 rooms away from mine, seperated by about 30-40'. Naturally he was a little skeptical...until he saw my screen laying on the floor...then we went out to see if we could see anyone...nobody or nothing around. Having two brothers and living in the country, I was used to seeing weird things happen so I wasn't too easy to scare...but this was a little beyond what was weird, and my room was soon rearranged so that my bed was on the same side of the room as the door, and I kept the window closed for quite some time after that.",

Coming back from Adrian Michigan, a larger town 20 miles from home, a group of us including at least three other kids and two adults and myself, came around the corner and down the hill on Beecher heading for Kiel Rd, when we thought we had spotted a bear standing upright in the clearing by the river. All of us agreed we had seen \"something\"...but there have never been bear in the area before. I got only a glimpse of the \"bear\", but I didn't believe that it could have been a bear...we went camping twice a year when I was young, and we went to Yellowstone seven times, where I have seen many a bear at very close range...this one didn't really look like the bear I had seen...but I did only get a short glimpse, as the animal ran off as soon as we got to the bridge going over Bean creek. The land this happened on is almost straight across from Kiel rd, and borders on Bean creek. Across the creek and up the steep hill, was the old boy scouts cabin, and the land to the south was all densly wooded and swampy, with the Bean running through it, for at least two miles until it got to Hudson. It was an open clearing that had recently been planted with small pines...the pines were fresh planted the year or so before, and were only about 3-4 feet tall at the time. It looked as if the animal had something in it's \"hand\" as if it were eating. We might have gotten about 100-150 yard from the animal before it ran off, and the time of day would have been probably mid to late evening...I can't remember how high the sun was in the sky, but it wasn't low enough to be in our eyes yet.

The land used to be farmland, so we had a couple of barns and then behind the barns was a large wooded hillside that led down to Bean creek...this whole area is quite remote, and we never saw anyone in the woods anywhere around us...but we played in this area often, even having a fort in the buckeye grove at the bottom of the hill. All the land across the road was farm land, and there was wooded lots to the north of our property...one thing of interest...at least to me... there was an old farm house a quarter mile to the north of us that an old farmer and his wife lived in...the floor was dirt and they butchered hogs in their living room...this shows how life was back at the time of the incident...very rural settings.",

      "OBSERVED": "This incident took place over 30 years ago (1979 or 1980) on the western side of the state, near Grand Rapids. It was the opening  of archery deer season ( that would make it Oct?) and I and two other fellows, one a coworker of mine at the time, drove up from our place of business near Detroit to a state forest (can’t recall the name now) located just (north?) of Grand Rapids. It was raining cats and dogs (!) that afternoon we left and when we got into the area that night, my coworker stopped at his parents house to pick up a small trailer for us to use while we camped in the state forest. We pulled up the next morning, set up camp and then staked out areas each of us wanted to hunt (my coworker was fairly familiar with the area but I was not). Nothing unusual happened that day and we finished hunting (with no result) and then stayed in the trailer that night. The next day I picked out another site not far from the trailer, a fairly large clearing a few hundred feet in diameter (the forest was a mix of hardwood and evergreen, if I recall) with a wide easement for power lines that had been cut into the woods that ran directly in front of the blind that I had set up under a tree ( I think that power line easement figures into what happened but at the time I had no idea of its significance). The morning went by and we (the other two fellows had staked out blinds in other parts of the forest )  took a break for lunch, driving to a small town, the name of which I can’t recall.  When we got back (early afternoon, probably about 1 p.m or so) I staked out my blind again, the afternoon being sunny and mild. That’s when it happened.  Suddenly, off to my two o’clock position, at the edge of the clearing, but back in the forest and out of sight, the most horrible and weird racket began. It sounded as if logs and tree branches were breaking (although I could not actually see anything, only hear) and from inside the canopy of forest came another STRANGE, loud, vocalizations (I remember being under the impression that there were more than one “person” involved out there),  almost as if someone was incoherently, intoxicated (it was the only way I could describe it at the time). These noises went on for perhaps 3 minutes and then stopped as quickly as they had begun. After that utter silence. Nothing else. After a few minutes I got up with my bow, knocked an arrow, and went over to the general spot to investigate but there was so much dead fall and brush there that I couldn’t get into the forest very far so I turned around and came back. That night I talked to my companions about what happened but nothing they could tell me shed any light onto the subject except that the three of us were the only other people in the area, so I ruled out it being other hunters. It wasn’t until a few months ago that I ran across the BFRO website and a TAPE RECORDING of the “vocalizations” that I heard that day (or something very, very close to it).  I was flabbergasted when I heard the recordings of  the so-called “Samurai chatter”. THAT was the vocalization that went along with the other noises that I heard. It’ taken over thirty years to clear up that enigma. While I had almost no knowledge of Bigfoot at the time, looking back on it, I suspect that one or more of the hairy things was traveling up that power line cut and spotted me sitting in the blind, then took to the forest again and stopped and tried some vocalizations and tree branch breaking in an attempt to intimidate me into leaving the area. They didn’t count on my ignorance; instead of leaving, I walked towards them to investigate. If I had known, at the time, what was probably in those woods, I would have headed back to the trailer and locked myself in.",

      "OBSERVED": "I am writing this for my neighbor Bill (not his real name). I interviewed Bill on December 25, 2010, and for additional details two times again. Bill said that when he was a teenager he went with a group of 11 relatives and neighbors from Detroit camping in the upper Lower Peninsula of Michigan. They camped west of Twin Lakes in northern Kalkaska County. The group was made up of several men, about 7 boys (ages 7 to 12 years), and Bill. They arrived on a Friday morning and set up camp about 50 ft from the road and in a spot where no one else had camped. They cleared away the underbrush and built two rings of rocks for their campfires. The two rock rings were about 30 ft apart. It was early Spring because Bill recalled there were still patches of snow on the ground under the trees during this trip. In the early evening, they roasted marshmallows and hotdogs –the children sitting around one campfire and the adults around the other.  From behind where Bill was sitting, a rock was thrown into the campsite. About 15 to 20 minutes later, two more rocks were thrown into the camp in quick succession.  The rocks were about the size of cantaloupes. Each rock landed and rolled only a few feet, suggesting the rocks had been lobbed upwards rather than thrown directly into the camp. The rocks had been thrown from beyond their camp clearing. The edge of the clearing was at least 30 ft away from where the rocks landed.  With the first rock thrown, everyone thought someone from their group had thrown the rock as a prank (perhaps while taking a leak in the forest). But when they looked around and saw that everyone was at the campfires, they realized someone else was throwing the rocks. I asked Bill what their reactions were to the rocks landing in their campsite. Bill said that they were surprised and thought it was weird that someone would or could throw such large rocks but no one was alarmed. Bill said that one of the adults had a firearm in his tent, but did not get up to get it. Early the following morning, Bill got up and drove west towards State Highway 66 in order to buy some supplies. He recalls that he was driving with a learner’s permit, so one of the adults rode with him. The road they were on was a narrow hard dirt road without a maintained, clear shoulder. It was like a fire road or logging road.  Bill had driven about 10 miles west of the campsite when he saw a large animal come out of the forest on the north side of the road. It emerged from the forest on all four limbs until it reached the road. On the road’s edge, it stood up and walked across the road in two steps, the first step was in the middle of the road, the second on the other side. Because the forest edge along the south side of the road was dense, the animal immediately vanished from sight as it reentered the forest. When Bill saw the animal, the sun was behind him and still very low, the trees cast long shadows, and he was about 50 yards from where it crossed the road. So he recalls only that it was bigger than a bear, its hair was darker red than a deer, and he was impressed by the strength or force of its stride. When Bill got to the spot where he had seen the figure cross, he stopped briefly but didn’t get out of the truck because the adult he was with told him to drive on. (The adult had been sleeping when the figure crossed the road and awoke when he stopped the truck.)  Because he was driving with a learner’s permit, he was 15 years old. As such, the year was 1962. He thought about what he had seen during the rest of his trip to the store. He thought what he had seen matched descriptions he had heard or read about sasquatch, but thought sasquatch was only seen in the Pacific Northwest. He had not heard of sightings in Michigan. So when he got to the store, he asked the store owner whether he had heard of any local sasquatch sightings.",

      "OBSERVED": "I have several encounters with Sasquatch. I also believe it was the same one both times although the encounters were 10 years apart. The first encounter was when I was in 2nd grade. I was born in 1963 so this was quite a few years ago. I was playing at a school playground in Kalamazoo Michigan. My mother, teachers and other students were also at the playground. The adults were setting up a picnic for the students. It was close to school ending for summer holiday. I wandered off in to a wooded area near the playground. It was a very peaceful and sunny day. I was picking up pine cones, etc. while moving through the woods. I was not paying attention to my surroundings and was looking down at the ground. I was stopped very abruptly when I physically ran into a Sasquatch. It was huge and towered over me holding a large limb from a pine tree open. He was using his right arm to hold the tree branch. I was not afraid because I did not know as a child that this was an unusual thing. I just thought it was natural to see such a thing in the woods. He stood on two legs. His face had expression. First expression was surprise/anger. His face calmed quickly to a gentle, almost observant glance. To see his face I had to turn my head straight up as if looking at the sky. His skin had a tawny reddish hue and his body and face/head was covered in a deep chocolate hair/fur. He stood looking at me for a long time. I did not move. I did not notice any odd odor. He was very quiet and his eyes were very gentle. I sensed he understood I was a child. He turned to his left, releasing the branch of the tree he was holding with his right hand. He walked away from me in long, strong strides. The branch he was holding swung loudly over head. It was a very tall tree and the lowest branch was several feet over my head. My second encounter happened when I was 16 years old (1979?). I was at my family home sitting on the front porch waiting for a friend to pick me up to go out for the evening. It was winter time. There was snow on the ground. This encounter also took place in Kalamazoo, Michigan. I heard a low gutteral growl coming from the side of the house. My parents were not home and it was dark outside. Our house is completely surrounded by woods. I heard large heavy stepping, something with great weight was moving slowly along the house to where I was sitting. I sensed it was a large animal. I stood up and walked off the porch and headed down the driveway towards the neighbor's home. I remember I started to sing softly to myself. The growling/knocking/walking noises stopped. Once I had made it down the driveway my friend pulled up in her car. I could see her looking at something on the side of our house. When I opened the car door I looked back at the house and saw a large figure peeking around the corner of the house. I recognized him as the same creature I had seen when I was a child. With that recognition I did not feel afraid. I felt almost relieved. The next day there were large footprints in the snow coming out of the woods along side my family's house. The footprints traveled to the front of the house, around a dogwood tree and down the front yard. My parents had someone come in to analyze the prints. They were told the prints were not a hoax but made by something/someone very large with much weight. It was winter time and there was deep snow on the ground. The prints were very clear and the snow beneath the print was particularly icy as if heat from the foot itself had melted the snow. I never told my parents about these encounters until a couple of years ago when they finally informed me that they had seen the footprints in the snow back in 79' and called someone to look at them. I am a dancer and choreographer. I grew up not only dancing at the studio but also dancing in my parent's living room that has large windows that look out to the woods in back of the house. I have often felt something was watching me from the woods. I never felt frightened of it though. Maybe because I believe humans are far more frightening that Sasquatch. I am sure I have experienced visits from the same Sasquatch. In a way I feel rather protective of the whole species because I believe he was protective of me growing up.",

Suddenly I'm struck with fear. Now, I'm six foot 230lbs and don't scare easily, and cant explain the feeling that came on me.

I have heard trees fall on occasion while in my stand and it was calm out, never really gave thought to why they fell. Also on several occasions I have been followed out of the woods, I would walk, it would follow, I would stop it would stop. Now we do have bobcats in the area and I have heard they will do this and have heard them. I know whatever it was I heard that night was no bobcat.

      "OBSERVED": "I have had more than one encounter with BF or some thing. The incident that I am going to describe here is just one of countless that I have had. It was late, midnight or so; I was camping in a swamp with a friend of mine. We both have been to the camp sight before its near where I grew up, deep in the center of this large forest mostly swamp but the edges of the forest is hard woods. They logged it out some years back and there are many tree tops and fallen trees in the center {Swampy area, almost bog like}. You could walk for miles just on down trees we crossed darn near the whole place like that on one of our excursions out there. Any way, the camp sight is on this stream, Bear Crick, is what we have always called it. There was a big bend in it right there and some of the only high ground in the immediate area. There where two huge old trees right there also, we had a small fire going and where sitting around talking quietly. I grew up with this guy and the two of us have camped regularly since we where young. The night was normal, in the sense of animal sounds and such.  I heard it first, if I remember right.  It was coming down the creek from the South, you could just make out the foot falls, though threw this point I should add, are many deer trail, the main one follows the creek and there is one that comes in from east, which is woods/swamp. This spot was just one of many on the creek that had a major crossing point for deer. We have had more than one come threw camp early in the AM and cross there. It came closer, about 30 yards or so and that is when it went off.  Points of note: I did have a 12 gauge with me and this was the last time I took it out camping there again. We had knives also. It started to scream? Howl? Vocalize at us and while it was doing this it proceeded to tear up a tree. I could not locate exactly which tree it was though in the AM. It went on like this for some time.  I grabbed up my gun and loaded it, my friend told me to quit freaking out and said he was going to go talk to it and DID.  He went into the woods about 10 feet or more beyond the campfire and stood out there.  I could barley see him in the darkness. {It was early spring at this time)  This went on for a bit more {a few minutes or so} and then stopped.  I heard nothing more, no movement, nothing.  It just went away. We have tagged this thing with the name Monkey Beast, for that was our first thought that some strange monkey was out in the woods with us. Notes: I never shot my gun, nor did I raise or level it toward the sounds.  The night was clear.  I am going to place my bet that we where right on one of the main run ways that IT travels.  I deduce this from other incidents that have happened at that exact spot.  Stuff has happened there like this about 8 or 9 times with a witness every time, but only one.  If there where more than that we did not hear or see any thing. I would guess though that we where a lot more noise too at those times. We have camped at this locating for around 5 years and in that area for 8 or 9 years. Why I never took a camera, or video recorder, tape recorder I don't know.  I have never found any tracks either and I have spent some time looking! During this incident we where around the ages of 16 or 17.",

      "OBSERVED": "This statement is true & accurate to the best of my recollection.  This incident happened on Monday following the 4th of July weekend of 2014 after my wife, daughter, son in-law & grand kids left our cabin in Kalkaska for home which is 180 miles south (of the cabin) in Laingsburg, MI.  My son age 21, who was a real disbeliever in bigfoot, stayed behind with me.  As soon as they left, I mixed bleach & water in a pump sprayer & started bleaching our cedar log cabin.  I thoroughly rinsed the bleach off with a garden hose after about 10 to 15 minutes. I like to do this a week or two before I put the finish sealer on it.  It was getting late in the day, there was about a half hour to 45 minutes of daylight left, when I heard what sounded like a stone or something hitting a fallen over shed that was to my left & behind me about 10 to 15 feet away. That caught my attention right away because I had thought just before that something or somebody may be messing with me because as I would turn to my left to reach down to pump more pressure in the pump sprayer I noticed a small stone about the size of a nickel slowly come to rest a couple of feet from my pump sprayer. I took a long steady look around me & saw nothing that stood out, but I was on a mission - I wanted to get the cabin bleached so I could leave for home. I then started the generator to get the water pressure up so I can rinse off the bleach.  I grabbed the hose & started rinsing.  The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I would often turn & look real quick behind me and then I seen the ferns parting, coming in my direction but not directly at me & a stone came to rest. I thought maybe my son might be messing with me because I have told him about a lot of strange things that have happened up here. So I yelled for him to knock it off. Then it happened again, another stone & another.  I went around to the front of the cabin to shut off the generator which is on the front porch.  I noticed my son was sitting in my truck about 30 feet away from the opposite side of the cabin where I was rinsing the bleach off, messing with his i-phone with the window up. I shut off the generator & was walking towards the truck as a stone hit & rolled off the front porch. I rushed to the truck to get him to get in the cabin. He thought I was joking at first. Then he seen I was serious then he experienced it himself. We got in the cabin, it was last light, I could still see out the windows and stones were still being tossed & now they were hitting the cabin but not hitting the windows. As I sat at the dinning room table I seen something large & dark move fast from the other side of my driveway to behind my truck. I grabbed my 44 mag,  reached in my pocket and sounded the truck alarm to scare it off.   By then it was real dark out so I closed the drapes. My son went to his bedroom and his bedroom wall was hit. The cabin was at times being hit by stones on at least 3 sides within seconds of each other. There had to be at least 3 throwing stones. My son was terrified. I immediately called Kim Fleming, she was there earlier just after my family left for home. My son counted at least 19 stones hitting the cabin, it is not uncommon to have my walls or door hit very hard & I mean whopped hard after dark, it will shake the log cabin & it scares the HELL out of anyone there. I bought the property in 1986, had a 25 ft. travel trailer there until I built the cabin in 1995-96    I have a little over 47 acres there. Lots of bears & cedar swamp.",

I thought perhaps I was seeing things, so I just stared at it. finally it moved. I was so scared, I ran about three miles The other strange thing was that there was this small house with hound dogs. The dogs sounded like they were going crazy. Anyway I made it to the lighted part of the road, and stopped running. A police man stopped me, and asked if I found her. I asked him \"who\" He said there was a 13 year old girl missing from the area. I don't know if they ever found her.

      "OBSERVED": "This occurred in western Michigan November of 1978, when I was about 13 years old. I lived in Cedar Springs, Mi on Myers Lake Road near 17 mile rd. The land today is a golf course. At the time, this was all rural farm land and woods. I hunted all around western Michigan when I lived up there. One evening while whitetail deer hunting, I was sitting in a cut corn field with about 5 or 6 inches of snow on the ground. It was just turning dusk. I had been sitting in this field for about an hour and a half. I was sitting on the ground leaning against a fence post looking over the field. There was a low wooded area behind me. All of a sudden, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt very uneasy as if something was watching me. I did not see anything although I was trying to be still while hunting. This feeling was not going away and I moved to look behind me and at the edge of the trees there was a Sasquatch standing there looking at me. It was dark brown, about 7 ft. tall, with hair about 6 or 7 inches long and the face was a little lighter than the rest of the animal. I turned back around quickly and thought to myself that what I saw couldn't be. I had not known anything about big foot at the time. I had a .35 Marlin rifle with a Tasco 3x9 scope on it. I turned back around to get a better look and it was still standing there just staring at me. I looked through the scope (he was standing about 150-200 yards away from where I was) and it definitely was a Sasquatch standing there. We looked at each other for about 2 or 3 minutes and I got increasingly scared of it, although it never made any indication of hostility. I got up and ran out of the field and across the road to my house. I did not tell anyone about the sighting until I was about 23 years old and was hunting with one of my best friends. There were reports of a 'Skunk Ape' on our hunting land in Southern Georgia on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. We often heard it screaming at night and supposedly the DNR cast foot print molds of it in the area. I then told my friend of my sighting as a child because I didn't think I would be ridiculed.I moved to North Florida in 1979 and have resided here since then. I know absolutely without question that they exist due to my experience. I really hope that it is proven some day.",

I am now 43 and do not live there anymore so I can't tell you the specific names of the roads but to this day I think I could take you there. I was fishing with my parents near Hudson, Michigan.  We were on a road that had a bridge on it that people fished at.  I think a way down is Lake Hudson Park.   There was woods down the way of the river. Toward the front of the wooded area was a really big raspberry patch. It was a bright clear day. It was hot and I was at the raspberry patch pulling the off the bush and popping them into my mouth.  I looked up and I saw a black outline staring back at me. I remember being absolutely paralyzed with fear.  The raspberry patch was very thick and dense and this creature was on the side of the patch towards the woods.  It wasn't a bear because it was more ape like and stocky. It was much to large to be a person and it carried itself more animal like than human.  I was close to it but because of the density of the patch and the thickness of the woods I didn't have a clear look at this creature. I remember just being so scared I was frozen, and then when I could finally break free I ran to my parents. They half listened to me but I called my mother today and she remembered me telling her about it. Later a wildlife officer came by and I asked him if there were any bear around the area and he laughed and told me no.  This happened 33 years ago, and the reason I am telling you this now is because after watching your show I remember connecting with something one of the people said and that was the fear that that runs through you when you see a squatch.

I was walking east along the RR tracks with my friend, who was 9.  We were picking up rocks and talking, and as we were getting closer to the RR bridge that crosses the Huron River (a fast stream at that point) we noticed an odor that smelled like old roadkill mixed with cabbage(?); in retrospect, rather hard to identify but very strong and very distinct. We were expecting to come across a deer or some other animal that had been killed by a train. While crossing the bridge (about 80'-100' long) my friend grabbed my arm and jerked it as if to show me something really quick. I looked over, and he was pointing down over the south side of the bridge. I took a few steps to look down, and about 20' below us was the biggest pair of hairy shoulders I had ever seen. The creature looked like an ape, but its shoulders were MASSIVE ! - as if it was wearing football pads under its skin. Because of this, its head looked almost small. It had dark brown fur which covered every part of the creature, though we never saw its face. It was crouching by the east bank of the river, looking down into the water.  It didn't appear to be moving much, and I don't remember splashing or ripples from where the creature was squatting. We didn't stay long-- I'd say we looked at it for 5-7 seconds before my friend started running east, and followed him. His home was about a mile down the tracks, and when we got there, he ran up into his room and locked the door. I had to call my father to pick me up (I lived on the east shore of Briggs Lake.)

The creature was upright, approximately 4.5 to 5 feet tall, moved extremely fast on two legs, and was completely covered in hair.  What I will never forget is the visual sight of it running across the road and then, in one single, seemingly effortless bound, leaping completely across and clearing a livestock fence that was approximately 4 to 4.5 feet tall.

We decided to drive north of Newberry to park on an old logging trail near Pine Stump Junction.  The three of us shared the one bottle.  It was not enough to get us drunk, but provided a slight buzz.  When our buzz had wore off, we started back for town.  It was around 10 pm and was quite dark when we were driving south on H37.  We were rounding a left hand curve in the road when our headlights shined onto a large black creature.  It was hunched down, kneeling over some roadkill. It was on the white line on the right side of the road and facing the right ditch, so it was broadside to us.  When our headlights shined on it, still in the crouched, kneeling position it turned and looked at us.  It stood on its hind legs and with two large steps, it disappeared into the woods as we passed at about 45 mph. It was about 7 to 8 feet tall, covered in black fur from head to toe.  The face was flat like that of an ape, not like a snout of a bear. I'm not proud to say this, but all three of us screamed like girls when we saw it.  We did not stop.  We rode in stunned silence for awhile, then I asked if we were going to report this.  My two delinquent friends agreed that we could not share the sighting with anyone.

      "OBSERVED": "To begin with, I'm not sure what I saw, but it was something I couldn't identify, so I thought this might be the right forum to approach it. During the summer of 1993, my brother and I were looking for Lake Superior Agates along the shore of Lake Superior about 3-4 miles west of the mouth of the Two-Hearted River.  It was mid-afternoon on a windy and overcast day.  When looking for agates you spend much of your time looking at the ground, but occasionally stand up to stretch your back and  look down the beach.  It was during one of these times I noticed a figure some 300-500 yards down the beach standing at the tree line in the direction from which we'd been walking.  My first instinct was that it was another agate hunter and I voiced this to my brother stating that we now had \"competition\". As I watch the figure I noticed that it did not bend over (which is typical of agate hunters) nor did it move from its position at the tree line. It was at this time I realized the stature of the figure when I compared it to the nearby pines.  I then asked my brother to retrieve my binoculars from by day pack on my back, because that was the \"tallest person\" I'd ever seen and wanted to take a closer look. I also thought I might be catching a rare glimpse of a bear.  Instead of handing me the binoculars, by brother observed the figure through them first.  When I asked him if it was a man, he said he couldn't tell, but it was \"a man-like figure\".  He then gave me the binoculars to get my opinion.  On looking at the figure through the glasses it was magnified considerably, though I could discern no color variations.  The figure was completely black.  I observed the figure walk from the tree line to the shoreline a number of times, but could not distinguish what it was doing exactly.  At one point the figure began walking towards us and made both my brother and myself quite nervous.  By this time we realized we may be seeing something extraordinary.  The figure cut another 100 yards between us in a very short period of time, but still no discernable color variations where you would expect to find them.  At this point, I observed the figure bend down and pick up a beach rock and toss it into the lake (underhand).  It was at this point when I decided it was a man and told my brother this based solely on the fact that it tossed a rock into the lake.  This seemed to satisfy both of us and we continued our rock hunting ignoring any subsequent activities of the figure. In retrospect, I believe we were so quick to identify the figure as human because we had to return to camp in the same direction and the alternative to the figure being human was unacceptable.  We did not look for prints on our way back nor did we discuss the incident until some days later (there was no reason to do these things, because we had resigned ourselves to identify the figure as human).  A few days later, we were conveying the story to a relative jokingly referring to it as our \"bigfoot story\".  When our relative asked us \"why wouldn't a bigfoot throw rocks\", we realized we may have identified it as human too quickly and unfortunately may have missed more detailed identification through the investigation of footprints.",

It is very difficult to walk through, not because of lots of water or mud, but there are fallen trees and dense small trees and brush.  My encounter occurred very deep in the swamp, almost 1/2 of a mile from the closest road or field.  I had been in a ground blind (a clump of fallen trees) all afternoon and I was facing south.  It was getting dark and I had heard some noises (not uncommon for dusk with all the animals in there) to the NE.  I waited until it was completely dark or a little after and abruptly started getting ready to depart.  I was on my knees packing up my gear and made alot of noise and flashlight movement.  After about 5-10 seconds I was shocked by the sound of a massive animal crashing through the woods to the NE headed South.  It got a little closer as it ran by at about 20 yards at the closest and I heard it for about 40-50 yards.  I immediately thought \"there is a huge hunter with no flashlight running at me\" which of course was ridiculous since I am one of the few people to even have ever walked in there.  It was not a deer which I have experienced countless times, the noise they make running through the woods is more varied and continuous.  This noise was very much a person running sound with the \"bang, bang, bang\" type pattern.  For all these years I have assumed it was a very large bear, but could never explain how it could run through those woods in such a straight line at a speed of a man running, and I have wondered if a bear could make the rhythmic \"thump, thump, thump\" sound of footstep crashes.  (There are alot of branches to break on the swamp ground).  Lately I have tried to understand what happened, and have only recently wondered if it was a large Bigfoot.  It didn't bother me too much back then.  It was completely dark and I never saw anything.",

As the creature was directly in front of us it looked at us, it was as surprised as we were, the deer continued on to the south west, the creature headed south east at that point into the pines, hard woods, hemlock and ceders, it was out of sight in about 15 seconds, they seem to be able to hide from sight pretty easy.  My Grandson turned to me and said,\"Holy crap Grandpa did you see that big black thing?\" all I could say was \"yup\",  and again the safety was taken off on my rifle as we walked the rest of the way out.  My Grandson wanted to take a peek and see if we could see it again, but we didn't.  To the east south east of us is a clear cut field which is the direction it headed in, and to the east of us is a jackpine plantation.  I feel the creature only went as far as it needed to be out of our sight, and probably to continue his hunt for venison after we were gone.

On these early morning walks I often scare up deer and occationally a bear so when I heard the noises of something running in the woods I expected to see some such animal.  Instead I saw what looked to me like a large man dressed in white running at an incredible speed.  He was about 50 yards away and I tracked him for some distance.  I was amazed at how he ran so fast through the dense undergrowth. He had to have long legs to be able to traverse the fallen trees and swampy areas. The next day I was walking in that same area and discovered tracks that confirmed to me it was not a man I had seen.  They were quite large - about 18 inches or so.  I could only see three toe prints thought there may have been more that didnt inprint and what may have been claws or long toenails that left a mark.  The distance between them was about three of my strides long.

We got back into this cove, the Tippy dam pond is huge, they call it the flooded forest. Its beautiful you could swear you were in Canada, very hilly. Huge hills back up to the water but all forest in every direction, very very remote. We were fishing sitting in the dead quiet when all of a sudden we were scared out of our minds!!! A huge rock that must have been the size of a bowling ball was thrown at are boat. At first we blew it off as if it were a fish jumping all though the distinct sound of a round ball hitting water is unmistakeable. So about 3 mts. went by when another one was thrown even closer to the boat. There was no way this was a fish, we shined a flashlight through the woods and could hear something moving fast thru the brush but could not make out what it was ..this area we were fishing is so remote there is no way any human would be out there let alone in the middle of the night ..I've never seen my brother scared, we are Michiganders, we deer hunt yearly spend days in the woods but we were scared that night.

We couldn't see what it was but it didn't appear to want us around.  My mom thought in may have been college students playing a prank or on drugs.  It was to big for that.

I'm not sure if the D.N.R. acknowledges them still being up here.  They usually say someone mistook a bobcat.  Needless  to say the locals know better.

      "OBSERVED": "About 10 years ago, in the Upper Peninsula of MI in pine and hardwoods country (mixed) I was riding my white gelding, SILVER just before dusk.  I was about 1 1/2 miles from my camp, when Silver stopped dead in his tracks on the dirt road we were on, and stared into the woods.  I looked in the direction his head was turned and to my surprise, I saw a tall white animal coming towards us at a quick speed.  It almost looked like my horse, coming at us!  IF I wasn't riding him at the time, I would have thought he got lost and it was him running towards me.  All of a sudden, the animal came within about 30 yards from us, stopped and turned to go sideways... running behind some pine trees.  HE just disappeared!!!  I didn't see him come out of the other side, go back, nothing. JUST GONE.  I was quite scared at the time, and real excited, too.  I was too scared to go into the woods to find where it went, or what it was for that matter.  I had white hair, looked like a horse standing tall, looking at me, but when it turned sideways, to run, there was no large body behind it.  IT looked like an upright animal running.  IT was totally silent, with no noises even though he was running through the trees, and in a very heavey blue berry patch area.  THE area has since been logged off in that stretch, and I know my kids saw something running in the woods the same summer while 4-wheeling.  We made a big joke about our albino sasquatch, and to this day, I do believe I saw something real remarkable.  I tell my story, and they laugh at me, but I know what I saw, and my horse saw it too.  HIS reaction was quite extraordinary.  I think what ever the animal was, it thought Silver was one of them.  HE looked so similar in the woods, til he turned and there was no body behind it.  I never reported it to any officials here as there isn't anyone to report it to.  Thought of calling the DNR about it, but I swear my family teases me terrible so I know I would get ridiculed about it if I went too public.  Everyone at camp knows of this though and I do tell it often.  I know it was something unique for me to witness.  We have a large wooded area in the U.P. where our camp is, with very rugged terrain.  Many bluffs are located in this area, and one large ridge runs behind where the animal was observed.  I have not seen this since that summer, and no one other than my children and their friends have reported any such sightings that I know of.

The new highway (Co Rd 553) runs parallel with the old highway. We were headed north on the old 553, as we approached one of the many downed trees across the road, I noticed a movement out of the corner of my eye. The creature appeared to be croutched low to the ground. I believe it was either trying to hide from us, or was sitting watching traffic on the highway perhaps eating or something. As the creature turned it's head to see us, I realized this was something unusual and began braking.  It slowly stood, somewhat hunched, like it was trying to stay low to the ground, I instantly realized it was walking on two feet like a human. I started to get quite scared and excited. I've never seen anything like this before. It cautiously proceeded out into the middle of the roadway, stopped, stood facing me and stared at me for what seemed like 3 seconds, then looked over it's right shoulder at a 6-8ft. embankment next to the road. I believe it was planning it's escape route. Then turned and looked at me again, this time about 5 seconds. By this time I was shouting to my friends to look at the creature as they pulled up on their motorcycles. The creature had no real noticable features, it's body was completely fur/ hair covered,the fur was similar to that I've seen on a moose, very dull looking. It had longish arms and the legs weren't very long in comparison. It's body was like a gorillas, I could see a face, but the flesh was dark like the fur. All I could really make out were the eyes, They were almost aglow, of course this must be from the sunlight shining down since the sun was at our backs. The creature moving very slowly towards the embankment and then lunged up the bank with ease. I lost sight of it for a second, then watched it run through the trees with great speed and agility. It even lept over a down tree like a hurdler.",

I just heard about the BFRO today from my mother who told me right away about this bigfoot investigation team coming to marquette and this subject is something im very passionate about especially after an encounter my bestfriend erik and i had a couple years ago , the only people i ever told was some family and ofcouse discussing with my buddy over the years since . So the night it happend was i believe in 2004 and sometime in late january . we were driving on the back road  just past Acocks Sanitarium on a dirt road that goes up to the right and heads back to some railroad tracks and LOTS of woodland . well it was between 9 and 10 and we very board and trying to find new places where we could snowboard so we decided to pull over there and walk up the road and see if we could find some good size hills back there . we got a couple flashlights out of my buddys car and started walking up the road past the gate . not even about 300 feet away from the gate we heard a strange sound but didnt think anything of it so we kept walking . i noticed what looked like very large prints in the snow to my right and right away thought it was from someone on snowshoes but even though it was late at night there was quite a bit of light out so even with the flashlights not on the prints you could see clearly they were to far apart in stride so this struck erik and i . we shined our lights closer on them and realized they were NOT from a snowshoer but there was clearly shaped FOOT prints , toes and all . it was very warm that day and even that night was pretty nice so i kept telling myself there is no way that its a bigfoot print and was telling myself that maybe the snow had melted a bit and made a footprint look larger but then i realized ok thats silly because its an actual FOOT print , clear as day and why would someone walk around the snow in bare feet and who would have feet that are that big . my flashlight was 12 inches long and i put it alongside it and the print was still quite larger than that and very wide . erik had a disposible camera in his car so i ran down and grabbed it and i even took a picture of the print . the stride on it also was very far apart , i walked in the snow next to it and i had to seriously spread my legs out far just to come close to the stride of these prints . i would almost have to run and leap to make those strides . so that really got me thinking and so erik and i were standing there discussing this whole thing not beliveing that it was real and not even 5 minutes after talking a huge tree across the road and down a little bank about 20 feet from us started shaking violently and the snow was falling off it and branches breaking so erik started running back towards the car and i followed . we sat in the car for a minute to just gather ourselfs of what it could have been and till this day we swear by what we saw . this is the first time ive ever wrote of this . and i just gotta say i think your BFRO is a great thing and i know someday bigfoot will be proven true .",

We were driving along and we decided to take a DNR access road. Nothing unusual was noticed as we drove along down to the lake other than the the lack of deer tracks that normaly criss cross the area. There had been a recent snow and the area around the lake was for the most part lacking any signs of movement except for a single set of  tracks  leading up from a bowl like depression and passing by the toilet building.  My wife pointed to them and asked me what kind of animal would make that track, when I looked over I noticed that the tracks were that of  something walking upright on two legs.  I stopped the truck and got out to look closer the snow depth is around 18 to 20 inches.  The length between the strides I would estimate to be between 45 to 50 inches the interesting thing was that the tracks were clean in that there were no drag marks  just a clean stride.  When I went to examine them there were a lot of drag mars left by me  and a few slips in the deep snow, my stride fell short by some 20 or so inches as I tried to match the stride.  I was unable to determine if there were any toe prints but the prints looked a bit irregular at the front of them.  The single set of tracks  continued up a trail and into a stand of pines.  I have no idea how long the tracks were there but the snow had only fallen the night before. I just wanted to get this down while it was fresh in my mind.",

The snow came nearly to my knees making walking difficult.  As I turned up my road I noticed foot prints leading down my road, at which time I attempted to follow in the tracks.  Needless to say I was amazed at how large these prints were and the distance between each print. . . the prints were approximately 15 inches long and 8 inches wide with a stride of approximately 4 feet.

      "OBSERVED": "About 2 years ago, sometime during warm weather, my husband and I were sleeping with our window open.  It was very early morning, and my husband was startled awake by a very high pitched screaming sound.  I was awakened just a few moments later by the same sound.  It sounded like a terrified woman, or a child's high pitch scream.  My husband was very scared, as he thought it was our 3 year old daughter that had climb out of her window and was walking on the dark road.  He ran downstairs to check on her and found her and our 2 year old son asleep in their rooms.  While he was checking on them, I heard the scream again.  My husband and I had never heard that sound before.  It gave us chills.  The next day, curiosity got a hold of me.  I started searching online for that sound, and came across supposed Bigfoot screams.  It sounded the exact same.  We even looked up screech owl noises, and many of the other noises that people have said this scream is.  Although the noises came close, nothing matched exactly, except the supposed Bigfoot screams.  That was the last we heard of those noises until recently.  The current situation is actually happening at my dad's house, which is about 2 miles if you take the road, and maybe 1-1.5 miles straight shot, from our house.  He moved to that house about 3 months ago.  A few weeks or so after he moved into the house, he told me one morning that he heard this screaming sound the night before that he had never heard before, and that it gave him chills.  I jokingly said that it was Bigfoot.  Well, one day I was watching Finding Big Foot at my dad's house, and he heard the sound that the cast had heard in the woods, and MM said was a Bigfoot.  He came into the room and said, \"that's the sound I heard, what was that?\"  -He did not know the name or content of the show I was watching.  My dad has said that a few times since, he has heard that same sound.  He also said that his dog, who is a lab mix, usually starts growling and the hackles on his back stand up, when there are animals, such as deer, in the backyard or in the woods across the river.  However, he said there are times when the dog acts like he hears something in those areas, and will run back into the house and hide.  There has also been one time, about 12:30 at night, my husband was letting our dogs outside, and he came into the house, at little scared, and said that he had heard that sound again.  The next morning, my dad told us that he heard the scream again, about 12:30 at night, and we told him that we had heard it too.  The latest \"event\" and the reason that I reached out to MM, was because my dad had our kids over at his house on Monday (5/14) evening.  Earlier that day, he had taken a few panoramic pictures of his backyard as he was playing with his dog.  My kids went over to his house around 7pm.  He had them outside most of the evening, in and out, and then they ate dinner.  Sometime around 9pm, my dad noticed a very large limb sticking straight out of the ground on the bank of the river. He looked back at the picture he took earlier and the stick was not there. The stick is probably around 9'-10' tall.  It was in the ground approximately 9\".  I have attached two pictures showing this.  I am in the picture, and I am about 5'6\".   My husband got to my dad's house about 15 minutes after my dad noticed the stick.  He started walking down to the stick, and had a very uneasy feeling, and only made it half way between the house and the river, when he heard a rustling sound in the woods across the river. That was when he turned around and walked back to the house.  I got to the house about 15 minutes after that, and my husband and I walked down the the stick to look for footprints and found nothing.  My husband mentioned that he did not have the uneasy feeling that time.  We looked around and tried to see if maybe the limb had fallen from the tree, and while this is a possibility, I feel it is very unlikely.  The conditions would have had to be perfect for this to happen.  My dad said the next morning, that he thinks that the limb probably fell from the tree, but I'm not convinced.",

We had been working on building a cabin all summer, just for fun.  We would often pack a picnic lunch and spend the day out in the woods.  I heard a noise, like snapping twigs, I turned around and saw in the distance a glimpse of a figure running that appeared light brown in color.  I first thought that it was one of my other cousins coming back to help and then dismissed it from my mind and continued on with the work.  Later that day when we went back up to Grandma's house I then discovered that it could not have been my other cousin, because he had a blue shirt on, not a light brown one. The following weekend, my Aunt, two of my cousins and myself were working on the cabin, we ate lunch and then my cousins and I walked up the trail and down an incline to play on the huge grapevines that we like to climb on. I looked up and saw a hairy brown man like creature sitting up against the fence post.  He was sitting on his behind with his legs bent up and his arms were wrapped around his legs.  He was just looking at us.  I screamed, my cousin looked over and we ran with my other cousin who is younger than us, she did not see what we saw.  I looked back once and the creature was standing in an upright position. I'm not sure if he ran after us or not, I was too scared to look back. To this day the cabin is not finished.

      "OBSERVED": "The sighting that occurred in the late 1960s was in an area which is off Hwy US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls.  This is where my brothers and I grew up. At the very end of the road, about 1 1/4  to 1 1/2 miles in, is an old farm.  My brothers and I, as kids, were driving deer in mid November during hunting season.  My brother was posted along the western fence line of a 40 that is 1/4 mile farther than the end of the road and then 1/4 mile or slightly more west. (I have looked for this 40 acres on google earth recently and it shows up very well.  You can still see the fence line.) My step-uncle raised beef so all his 40s were well fenced with 4 or 5 strands of barbed wire and roads along all the fence lines.  As we were maybe half way through our drive, two deer came running towards us and jumped the northern fence line. When we finished the drive and I talked to my brother he was excited and scared, he said he saw an abominable snowman.  We didn't know about bigfoots back then.  I didn't want to believe him but he wasn't the type of kid to make up a story like that. I saw tracks in the snow but I just thought it was from the deer. Now that we are adults, he is 53 now, his story is the same.  He said when he was posted he saw movement out of the corner of his eye and looked along the fence line.  The bigfoot stepped over the barbed wire fence, coming from the west, and then stepped over the fenceline on the north, the direction the deer went.  He said It was huge, about 8 feet at least, and hairy, brown/black and could just step over the barbed wire fence with no problem.  The area was wooded with mature aspen and evergreens with some underbrush.  There are lakes in the area and springs and a railroad grade.  The weather was clear and it was around mid day. There was some snow cover on the ground but not very deep. The wildlife in those days was mostly deer and bear.  Now there are wild turkeys, wolves, coyotes, bobcats, deer and bear.",

About 1/4 mi. east of the Bates-Amasa Road and slightly west of the road side park, a Bigfoot crossed the highway in front of her.  It was going from south to north. The area to the immediate north of the Hwy has very old mature Elm and Maple/hardwoods with little underbrush then fades to older farm lands.  The area it came from has hardwoods immediately by the highway going back to brushy clearings with raspberry brush and then my aunt's backyard. I also want to talk to my cousins who live where my niece had her sighting as they were kind of terrorized one night while sleeping in a \"fort\" they had made in the wooded lot next to their house. They were 4 tough boys and did not want to stay out there again. (That was when we were kids.) We are all in our 50's now.",

      "OBSERVED": "It was the morning of the New Year in 1979 during the pre-dawn hours.  I took my wife with me to help search out a deer I thought I may have wounded while hunting the prior evening.  There was plenty of snow in the Tuttle marsh that year so we were able to see even though it was 6:00 a.m. approximately.  A storm had been predicted for New Year's day and I knew if I was to have any chance of retrieving my deer, I would have to be out there early. We were about a half a mile off old U.S. 23 and the heavy snows that year meant leaving the car parked on the highway.  When we got to my ground blind I positioned us exactly as I had been the previous evening to get some bearings as to when to begin our search. It was already beginning to snow and as we peered through the blind we could see a tall dark image moving towards us.  We simply froze in the blind and watched.  It was a two-legged, ape-like creature about 7-8 ft. tall with a heavy coat of fur.  Had it not been for the size, I would have dismissed the sighting for a local hunter who I had encountered a number of times who always wore a three quarter length heavy fur coat. This man stood as tall as me at 6 ft., however, when this creature walked past and I saw it's head brushing the tops of the tree limbs which were about two feet over my head, I had a pretty good idea of its size. My wife and I never said a word, but after about ten minutes she whispered, \"Let's get out of here!\"  We made one of the quickest exits imaginable through heavy snow over a half mile distance The only people I have ever relayed this story to have been family members who had a good laugh.  However, the following week or so the Oscoda newspaper had an article regarding Big Foot sightings in the area where we had been, and my aunt who delivered mail in Oscoda sent us a clipping.  I've hunted the area many times since and never had any such encounter again.",

The land is hilly and fairly heavily wooded, has a river run through it, and covers a large expanse of land, so there are many remote areas inaccessible to most casual adventurers.  We were riding up the hill leading into the deeper part of the trail, when we stopped to rest, just as we stopped we heard a deep growling kind of sound that was so loud, you could kind of feel it even though the sound came from a good distance away. My friend and I were at a loss to be able to explain the sound...it was as if something was letting us know it was there...but we never saw anything. After a couple of minutes, the loud \"growl\" was heard again...just about as close as the first time. My buddy and I just joked it off as being \"bigfoot\", but I have lived near that area almost all my life, and I heard stories of people seeing something strange out there since I was a small kid...I am now 38 years old. Also, when I was a kid, a group of us came around a corner near my house when we saw what we thought was a bear..we only got a small glimpse of the \"animal\", and I was probably 10 or 11 at the time...so I don't have too vivid a memory about the encounter, but there were 4 or 5 of us in the car, and at least 2 of us were adults and we all agreed that we had seen something. I have ridden the trail several times since the day of the strange sounds, and I always get the feeling of being watched, if I am by myself, I either won't ride that section of trail, or I won't stop at all for the entire 5+ mile section...and I am always looking over my shoulder and all about...the whole area just gives me a weird feeling, and it is so thick in spots that there are several places that something could hide out in...we had even talked about how easy it would be to go in and camp and never see anybody. I wouldn't even think about staying overnight there now.

      "OBSERVED": "I lived in the swampy woods surrounded by stateland in Michigan.  I absolutely love walking through the trails in the woods, the solitude of it.  So my feelings that I was not alone in the woods started when I was 15 and I got into a fight with my dad and took off into the woods.  I got lost.  It became dusk and started to rain.  I sat on a fallen tree and sobbed.  Then, like a switch was turned, I felt like I was being watched.  It was so unnerving I looked around, then just ran.  I did get out of the woods, but it was after dark. Fast forward to age 18. I was pregnant and walking down the road with my boyfriend.  It was dark and we both felt like we were being watched.  I thought it might be a bear, because a neighbor of ours had a black bear in captivity and it had gotten out.  We never saw anything though. When my son is one week old.  I'm feeding him during the middle of the night, we are alone in the house on the sofa in front of the big window in the living room, and suddenly there were 5 knocks on the side of the house!  I didn't see anything when I looked. One week later, I got up during the night, again to feed my son who was crying, and when he was put back to bed I went to my own room.  I had a waterbed and because I had had a c-section, it was difficult getting in and out of the bed... so I was sitting on the wood side of the bed, looking down at my sleeping boyfriend.  I felt that feeling again at the same moment I heard this thing grunt/growl.  It sounded loud, yet muted, very guttual.  I turned to the window and saw it.  It was looking into a window that had to be 9 ft up... I lived in a mobile home, this was a typical window for trailers.  I only had a nightlight on in the hallway, and it was dark outside, but I could still see it for the most part.  The size of the head was huge.  Covered in reddish brown hair (at least that's what the color looked like in the low light), a little bit long- not like dog fur or anything, more like a medium haired cat has longish hair. The hair was covering the whole of it's face from what I could make out. The nose was very wide with huge nostrils.  It absolutely looked pissed off.  It was staring at my boyfriend. I froze to the spot.  I couldn't even breathe.  Then it was gone.  It took awhile before I could speak... I have no idea- several moments.  I was so scared that when I tried to speak I was stuttering and breathing frantically. Of course my boyfriend didn't get up, hence he is now an ex... but the next day we did walk around the house looking for blocks or something that someone could have stood up on to look inside, but found nothing.  It was rainy out that night, but we couldn't see any tracks of either shoes or feet because the ground was covered in layers of dead leaves. I believe that I saw bigfoot that night.  I believe he was, indeed, pissed off because he saw my boyfriend in my bed.  I believe he found me when I was 15 and had 'followed' me since. Either that, or he (or she) was investigating my crying infant. So, I believe your search for bigfoot using a crying baby might actually help you out if you tried it more often. ??",

I thought I'd go explore Langford Lake, Pomeroy Lake, and Moosehead Lake. I was driving toward Langford Lake campground, and I took US-2 from Watersmeet and made a left onto CR 527.  About 1/2 way before I got to Langford Lake Rd., I was shocked to see what looked to be \"a monkey with a bear's body\" right in front of the car.  This \"being\" crossed the road right in front of the car.  If I hadn't have slammed on the brakes, I would have hit it!  It was NOT a bear.  I have seen tens of bears in both rural Michigan and rural Virginia over the past 30 years, some while driving and some while hiking, some even face-to-face.  This was not a bear.  All I kept thinking to myself was \"why is there a monkey in the woods? why is there a monkey in the woods?\".  I was stunned and baffled and my mind just couldn't \"figure it out\".  It was like the very first time (while in rural Virginia) I saw a cougar (up close and personal in our yard).  My mind just couldn't comprehend.  After the being crossed the road, I stopped the car and tried to look for it.  There was a small gully on the left that it must have gone down into; but I couldn't see it.  The brush was thick.  I was stunned.  My mind couldn't make sense of it all.  Here was this being, maybe 5 feet in length, dark black-brown, four-footed, running on all fours (not running like a bear runs, I've seen that too), with its underbelly about 2 feet off the ground.  Long and lean, it seemed to me.  Not running very fast, but brisk.  Of all the funny things in the world, it \"seemed\" to be \"smiling\".  It was not threatening at all.  It seemed very innocent.  No pointed head, eyes brown, not a snout.  Not a furry face.  Looked like a monkey's face.  No tail.  It all happened so fast and I wish I had been able to follow it, once it crossed the road.  This was not a bear cub - I have seen at least a half a dozen of them in my life too - climbing trees in the Adirondacks, crossing roads in central VA.  I am still baffled to this day as to what this being was; although something in my gut tells me that I saw a \"baby bigfoot\".",

      "OBSERVED": "Observed a large creature, about 8' tall, covered with short brown hair, man-like face, black or very dark eyes, standing under a tree approximately 75' from my uncle's weekend cabin. When I was 13, I was invited to spend the summer with my aunt and uncle in Escanaba. Every Friday evening, we would leave Escanaba and go to their summer cabin in Dickenson County. The Cabin was built by my aunt's father and was in a very heavily forrested area off Rt. 69. We would usually arrive around 6:00pm, have dinner and walk in the woods. This one particular Friday it had rained earilier in the day so we decided to stay near the cabin and just relax. My aunt had gone into the back yard to get something and then came running around the house yelling there was a bear in the yard. My uncle went in to get his rifle and I went in the back to see the bear (I was from New Jersey and that's quite a common sight there). When I got around the house, I was stunned to find our visitor was no bear. He (or it) was standing under a tree approximately 75' from the house. His right arm was drapped over a branch and he was standing like he was waiting for a bus. My aunt had followed me into the yard and she was behind me crying and shaking like a leaf. At that point, my uncle came out onto the back porch and I took several steps toward our visitor. I don't know if it was my forward motion or the sight of the rifle, but our visitor decided that was time to leave. He turned and walked back up the old deer path alongside the tree and disappeared into the woods. We found only scuff marks and not tracks because of the heavy pine needles on the ground. I would also like to mention that my uncle's German Shepard found a safe place in the house and refused to come out. From that time on, the dog would jump out of the car and into the house and never again walked with us. We went every weekend, but never saw our friend again. However, for years, my aunt felt uncomfortable going up there and finally my uncle sold the property in the mid 70's. I never thought about what we saw until an article appeared in the old ARGOSY magazine (late 60's) about the \"MINNESOTA ICEMAN.\" I firmly believe we encountered something like it that night.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "We never heard from our visitor again, but thought he had visited us again several times because the dog would head for the closet and hide on several occasions.",
      "OTHER_WITNESSES": "My uncle and I were sitting on the front porch throwing a ball for the dog and he was retrieving it. My aunt was in the back yard doing something unknown.",

I could sense the degree with which her experience affected her. She said she was getting shivers down her back talking about it and then she would giggle and wring her hands out to put herself at ease. When she was 17, she was driving north on County Road 426 between Cornell and Watson. She approached a slight bend in the road to the left. It was just getting dark out and she had her headlights on. On the right hand side of the road she noticed something standing 60 yards ahead. It was standing on the asphalt, just on the edge of the road. She was going 50 mph but slowed down to 30. At first she thought it was someone hitch-hiking. It was looking at her the whole time it took her to get up to it. What she first noticed was its arms and hands that hung down past its knees. Right away she knew it wasn’t something normal. It was 8 - 9 feet tall and had black hair. It “wasn’t really long”, and the hair “looked smooth”. Its build was huge, like an ape man. She didn’t see any skin other than the dark gray in its face. It looked like a “prehistoric man with an ape face”. She made eye contact with it at 15 feet and saw its eyes glowing a “blood red”. The eyes glowed red from the reflection of the car headlights. She could see by the look in its face that it was just as scared of her as she was of it.  It turned away from her and in one jumped- jumped 10 feet into the swamp.  Its motion was unnaturally fast, “it was unreal how fast it was”. She feels she saw it for 7 seconds. As she passed the spot where it was standing, she stepped on the gas to get out of there fast.",

      "NEAREST_TOWN": "Grayling",
      "NEAREST_ROAD": "Roberts Road",
      "OBSERVED": "The creature was not tall by any means probably in the low 6 foot range, I would compare to my current height of 6'1\".  The hair/fur was a rather rusty brown and wavy or matted. It didn’t look like a recently cleaned coat if you were to compare it to cleaning your dogs coat etc. It looked like it was unkept and even sort of dread-locked appearance hair. I do recall that some of the hair on the body was rather long about 10 inches and I could see it move as the creature walked away. It looked a lot like of the reggae/rhasta type hair styles but not completely covering the body but just various strands of it throughout (maybe shedding from winter??).  The creature had a rather glum face or expression, like a lonely old man who didn’t have any friends. I do recall its eyes sort of reminding my like that of an orangutang and sunken in.  It by far didn’t look evil, or mad in any way even though we were terrified. I think we may have woken it up and it was surprised and maybe a little irritated that it had to leave its comfortable seat next to the creek.  The hair around its head sort of drooped down on the sides. There didn’t seem to be much hair on its face but it did have some. The nose may have been flat. I don’t recall any details about the mouth or ears etc. Its possible it had a slight cone shape to its head but not drastic.  I don’t recall any smells or odors associated with it.  There really wasn’t a neck and when it moved its legs just seemed to float forward without any obvious effort. The animal appeared confident, agile and very graceful.  Once it disappeared into where-ever, I don’t have clear details into the rest of the moment.  I know we walked over to the site and I felt the tree where it was sitting and recall it was warm to the touch.  I think we looked around for tracks and there may have been some but it was so mucky and swampy it wasn’t clear, but I’m fairly certain we could at least see that the ground and brush was a little disturbed etc.  There was not a lot of vegetation between me and the creature as far as having part of my vision blocked. I could see the entire creature for the most part except for minor sticks and things in the way as it moved.  We more than likely hung out at the spot for sometime recalling what we saw as young kids do. I think back now though, that I don’t recall each of us sharing exactly what the other one saw because I think we each thought that we saw the same thing.  As far as arm size or length I don’t recall a big size comparison but I think they were a little longer than a humans. It seemed to walk with its arms to its side with maybe the forearms slightly facing out/forward like a jogger but its arms didn’t swing at all to my recall. I was totally aware of such a creature as Bigfoot back then, even through I don’t recall us saying it was “bigfoot”. I think I believed in this creature the moment I had seen the Patterson film in the early 70's maybe a few years before my sighting.  It just seemed real even through what I saw didn’t resemble that one very much. Its possible what I saw was rather old. It just had the sense that it was wise and old.  I don’t feel that my prior belief or viewing of the Patterson film caused in anyway to make up what I saw in any way or influence/convince me in seeing what I saw, since they were slightly different in appearance etc. There were other reports in and around N. Michigan the entire time I grew up there. In fact a year or two after my sighting there had been accounts in the local newspaper (Crawford Co. Avalanche) of strange sighting and incidents by members of the National Guard. I heard that about 40 people watched a creature on the artillery range with binoculars for awhile and that something was jumping on a tank and banging on the outside while there were soldiers inside.  They did not see what it was because it was nighttime but the story’s I remember is that it was being called the “tank-banger”.  There have been many numerous sighting in and around the Grayling area through the 70's. I had briefly mentioned my story to the other friend who was with me about a year ago just to see if he remembered it.  I think he was surprised that I did too and seemed to not have as vivid of a recall as I feel I have.  In fact he was unsure of what he saw and sort of felt it was a human. Anything is possible and I respect what he claims to have seen, but I have no doubt that what I saw was how I described it above.  I never felt at the time it was a human or a bear, it felt like something unknown to my mind and creepy. Since we never talked about details after our sighting, I just assumed they saw exactly what I saw and they felt the same about me, unfortunately we didn’t compare our stories the moment it happened. I don’t recall who my third friend was but I’m certain there was one other with us. Some of the minor details have faded since this is about 35 years ago but the appearance of the animal has always been clear to me.",

      "OBSERVED": "Reading another report of a Bigfoot sighting in Delta County, MI 1982 has prompted me to report the following. My family has property in Delta County (near Cornell - UP Mich).  One evening during hunting season (November 1982) I was at the camp alone.  It was approximately 11:00 at night.  We had no electricity and was playing solitaire with a kerosene lamp for light and a wood stove for heat. I was planning on spending night and getting to my hunting blind in the morning. A fairly loud \"whack\" startled me. Something had hit the window/screen behind me.  I turned around and looked at window but I couldn't see anything.  I walked to window and peered outside but it was dark and couldn't see anything.  I figured it was just \"the wind\" or something so sat back down.  A few minutes later it happened again.  Another fairly good \"whack\" to the window.  This startled me even more.  I started to think possibly someone was playing a practical joke on me.  The camp is approx 30-40 feet from any trees and no branches could be \"brushing up against\" the cabin. There is an apple orchard near it. Maybe 100 yards away. I shined a strong flashlight outside and couldn't see anything. After a couple of minutes I closed drapes as tight as I could and sat back at table with loaded rifle next to me. A few minutes later I heard a large whack against the window and also multiple whacks and hits, dragging down the side of the camp!  This flat out scared me and I grabbed my rifle and yelled as I walked out the door with flashlight in hand.  I circled the camp a couple of times calling out.  (saying things like \"who's out here?!\"  If you are playing around you need to be careful because I will shoot your *$$!\"). Well I was scared. I packed my things and locked up camp and left that night.  The gate (about a 1/2 mile or so from camp) was still locked.  (you needed a key to get onto property). I don't have any idea what/who did that but a bigfoot sighting 1 month earlier/same year (nearby - within a mile) reported here on this site prompted me to post this report. Maybe relevant (maybe not). Also - I think I will mention this...perhaps it has no relevance to Bigfoot.  The same year out in my blind I heard a really strange sound.  It sounded kind of like an elephant trumpeting.  It was probably about 50 to 60 yards behind my hunting blind. I have never heard of a bigfoot making that kind of sound but that is as close as to the sound I would describe it.  It didn't sound exactly like an elephant trumpeting but close.  I heard it twice.  Once close and then one more time further in the distance. Very weird but  -  that's what I heard and that's the best way I can describe it.  Very loud.",

If it is, you can continue on foot up the road about 1/2 mile to the site. If it is open you can drive up. Be careful is you don't have a 4x4 or good clearance. There has been some significant logging in the area so the way in is much different than it was at the time but the actually site is pretty much unchanged. If you have read the description above, you will know it when you get to the right spot.",

      "OBSERVED": "This took place in the summer of 1986. Myself and four other friends decided to go on an over night camping trip about 2 miles from my friends house. There were 3 men and two women all together. The ages ranged from 15-17. The area we choose to camp in is known as the Beaver Pond (at least to us and our friends it was). We were driven, by my friends father, to within a half mile of where we planned to camp. We hiked in the rest of the way in with our tent and supplies. The area we were camping in was on a ridge that ran along an old small lake. Our campsite was on the top of the ridge on an old road that was used as a snowmobile trail in winter. To one side of our campsite was a steep hill that went right down to the waters edge. On the opposite side the ridge sloped down into a swampy area, very thick with brush. On either end of the camp the ridge continued for a short distance, 20 yards or so, before sloping down into the lower, thicker woods. We arrived at our site after dinner time, probably around 6 or 6:30 I'd say. We had a large yellow one room tent that we set up on the top of the ridge looking over the lake. We set about gathering firewood and getting ready to make some hamburgers. The evening proceeded uneventfully for several hours. Being teenagers, we didn't plan on getting much, if any, sleep. I should point out that we were a pretty straightlaced group so there were no drugs or alcohol being used that night. As I remember, we built our fire and made something to eat and sat around the fire drinking sodas. We never really ventured far into the woods around our site. Perhaps a few yards to gather wood and down to the waters edge. As best I can recall it was about 1 or 1:30 a.m. when first something happened. Another thing I should mention here is that as children having grown up in the woods and around outdoor activities, we were all very comfortable out of doors and very familiar with the creatures that inhabit the Upper Penninsula. The first thing that happened was a distance noise. It sounded much like a screeching sound a chimp might make. It sounded quite distant, probably over a mile as it was barely audible. It came from the direction of the swamp. The swampy area at the base of the ridge was not actually all that large, maybe a quarter mile thick. So, we realized that the noise must have been coming from the pine forests on the other side of that swamp. I know even though the first sound was very faint and short it gave all of us a strange feeling. We tried not to think much about it and returned to whatever conversation we were having. A few moments later we heard the noise again. Much clearer and closer this time. I would estimate that it was probably 400-500 yards away. Still a good distance but significantly closer than before. It was again, one lone 2 or 3 second screech. After hearing this one we were unable to go back to our old conversation and began to discuss the noise and it's possible sources. We all agreed that none of us had ever heard anything exactly like before. One of us ventured that it sounded like an animal in heat might. The other said that sometimes an animal being killed can make a terrible sound. No one was satisfied with either explanation. We sat, fairly quietly, waiting to see if we would hear more. After a few moments the screeching began in earnest. Whatever was making the sound had come to within 40-50 yards of our site and was at the base of the ridge down on the swampy side. It almost seemed as if the thing had made a direct line for our camp from the first moment we had heard it. The next 3 hours were truly terrifying. The thing began to move around our camp. Always staying at the base of the ridge. It circled all the way around us, going from the waters edge on one side to the waters edge on the other. The sounds varied coming from the woods. Sometimes we could hear the sound of branches breaking as though something large were moving in the trees and other times we could hear nothing moving. Sometimes it would move around us, screeching as it did so. Other times it would make its noise in one place and then make it again on the opposite of the camp a minute later without our having heard one bit of movement from the woods. We tried shining our flashlights out into the woods but could see nothing. I can't remember if it had a reaction to our lights but I don't believe so. Over the next three hours this continued. Sometimes the thing would go silent for perhaps 5 minutes or so only to erupt again with a fresh tirade. We had no idea what to do or think. I can honestly say that all of us were more frightened than we had ever been before. We had no weapons save a pair of the \"Rambo\" style hunting knives that were popular among teenage boys in the 80's and a couple of pocket knives. We kept the fire going strong. I remember a couple of times when we all went inside the tent just to feel a little safer but we would quickly come back out when the thing would quit for a few moments. I'm not sure if we thought it was going to sneek up on us or what. I do remember feeling very insecure when it would get silent. At least when it was making noise we knew where it was. This is how things went until around 4 a.m. At around that time the screaching ceased and the thing left exactly the same way it had came. We heard a screech after a few minutes that seemed to be several hundred yards away and then one more in the distance and then it was gone. Suffice to say we did not sleep. At first light we took off at a jog down the dirt road towards the main road. I wish that we had taken more time to look for signs but we were all just scared. I do remember that we did take note of the fact that we saw no tracks on the sandy dirt road despite the fact that the thing must have crossed it 2 or 3 dozen times that night. Again, I have to say we didn't look very thoroughly though. We just wanted to leave. We walked to my friends house about a mile and half to two miles away. We told his father all about what had happened and we were promptly dismissed as having overactive imaginations. This is what would happen with every adult we shared our story with. We did go back later that day to get our gear. My friends father gave him the truck so we could drive right into our campsite. We threw our things in the back and got out as quickly as possible. It has been several years since this has happened. I've told many people about it but never anyone who was in a position to truly evaluate or have an interest. I have heard some of the bigfoot sound recordings and have to say that some of them are very similiar to what we heard that night. I've had many explanations proposed to me about what happened that night but none has ever satisfied me.",

Then after about 20 feet it stops and a few seconds later we both hear a tree getting just ripped down with force. It then like went silent on us, I was trying to see in the thick brush to get a visual but i never did get to see it, but i could hear it trying to hide in the straw grass. I could hear it swaying I believe I threw some rocks to try an illicit a response but there was no rocks it could of thrown back and that pretty much it the river had prevented me from just going in after it. Ross wanted to leave and I didn't swim across and investigate like I should have, its been a big regret. We were supposed to go fishing so we left.

      "OBSERVED": "November 26th, 2016. A friend and I were taking a walk out at Days River Trail on the outskirts of Gladstone, MI.  in the Upper Peninsula. We arrived around 7 p.m.  My friend didn’t want to be there in the dark but I am an intuitive medium and I have no fear of the dark with the things I deal with. I have been to Days River Trail many times during my lifetime but only within this last year has this place been an interest to me to see what it feels like at night. We decided to walk the outer trail once we cross the bridge over the river. We took a right after the bridge and before we hit the corner we looked up and saw this light, high up to our left, up over a small ridge. It was a bright light, shining but not moving at all. Still. We took our mini flashlights and were trying to see what it was or where it was coming from and then started talking loud and it did not move, not at all. We kept walking, not long after the first corner we heard something walking to our right which is on the river side and it would have been down an embankment. It was definitely on two feet not 4. I grew up in the country and know a lot of what animals sound like.  My friend was worried and asked me what I thought, I didn’t want her to run so I said I think it’s a deer let’s keep moving.  We got farther into the woods and started looping in the inside trails and it was a beautiful night, not too cold and somewhat clear out. We came to a place where there is a bench and a fire pit. We stopped there for about an hour and just talked since we don’t see each other often. Both of us felt like we were being watched but not in a dangerous way. I usually “see” things wherever I go since I am an intuitive/medium. I couldn’t “see” anything this night just had a feeling of being watched. As we left and started walking the trail around the other side of the forest, (we would be eventually coming out to the left after the bridge.) We could smell something that was skunk like but not really. I can’t describe it.  Bad body odor? skunk?. That smell stayed with us for a bit then disappeared. As we got closer to the bridge we were both feeling like it was time to go, it was close to 10 p.m. now and BTW we were the only people out there. Typically no one walks out there alone or in groups at night.  (Just for FYI reasons to there is a meat packing plant across the road from the entrance to this trailway.) We crossed the bridge, and started hearing this “crying” noise that made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. I had never heard anything like this. I am 50. I grew up in the woods. I feel like I know animal noises. This was something different. It kept calling or crying until we got to the beginning of where we started. I felt like whatever/whoever it was didn’t want us to leave.  My friend thought it was a wounded animal. At first I did too but after listening and deciphering I know this was something completely out of my scope of what I know. I started doing research the moment I got home. I am convinced I experienced the all elusive Bigfoot. I found audio from others on Youtube that matched exactly what we heard. I went back a few days later alone during the day around 1 p.m. I decided to go directly to the left after the bridge and made my way to the area about where the  calling or crying would have come from. I stopped at this very large tree and just stood there patiently waiting. Maybe 10 minutes after I got there, I heard it again, this time it seemed farther away and less of a crying and more of a whistling , to me it felt like whatever this is was just letting me know it knew I was back. I didn’t stay long because in my intuitive vision I saw a cougar/mountain lion and know that they have been seen out here before and caught on camera. So, I thanked whatever was out there for letting me “hear” it again and went on my way to document this experience.",

That night, one of the same kids was with me, and we knocked on one of the other cabin doors.  Before they could answer we ran and hid on the two track where we had found the tracks.  Off to the left I heard a low growl.  My friend heard it too and we ran back to the cabins. We went to bed and planned to go out and look for whatever had made the tracks and the noise.  I waited for everyone to go to sleep and while I waited I heard what sounded like a woman screaming.  It was a scary sound.  It was like someone scared a woman and she screamed but without being hysterical.  It wasn't like a panicky scream.  Anyway it was an all boy camp and all male councilors.  Some of the cooks were women and also the main preacher guy had his wife there.  Oh, the sound also came from roughly the same place as the growl and the tracks. I am afraid I am not too good of a source.  I was in Fifth grade then and it was July of 1984.  Neither me nor the other kid have said anything since then unless we were joking around.  Nobody would have believed us from the camp.  And that night it rained so the tracks were washed out.  I went back to the camp for a few more years and always hoped to find something to prove that what I saw and heard was REAL and not just a imaginative kid.  The tracks might have been someone walking barefoot and expanded by the mud drying but I could swear that it had three toes and the steps were kinda of far apart.

      "OBSERVED": "I’m 50 now, but when I was 15 my father had a modern cabin, I designed and drafted, in lower upper Michigan, near Gladwin, Michigan.  I saw your Michigan episode today and wanted you to know about something I saw in the woods near Streaked Lake.  I know the county pretty good as I hunted, fished and snowmobiled in the area.  We lived in Brooklyn, MI and would travel to the cabin on my dad's days off.  The winter of 77/78, don’t remember the month, my younger brother and I were out doing nighttime, off trail snowmobiling.  We were on the state park next to my dads place.  My brother was leading, we were in Cedar Pines most of them not more than 10 inches in diameter (I know this because my dad use to have me cut firewood, and poles for fences.) Snow was pretty deep and we were moving over snags pretty good at about 10 mph.  My brother took a turn ahead of me, he was about 50 feet or so in front of me, as I began my turn to follow to the left my headlight caught something next to a 6” cedar, it stood about 7 or more feet, it had its left hand on the tree, looking over its bicep at me, its body was turned toward my brother.  I thought I was seeing things but its body was showing on the other side of the tree.  A bear came to mind but then as I was watching it, a gorilla is what I thought.  As I made my turn it was about 10 feet off to my right.  I picked up speed, craning my neck as I watched it stand there following me with its head.  I caught up to my brother and told him to head back to the cabin but on the trails.   I stayed right behind him until we got back to the cabin about 20 minutes.  I never saw the thing follow so I have always been somewhat reluctant to say something.  When we got inside, I told my dad and brother what I had seen.  I was pretty terrified when I saw it and stayed that way through the night.  The next morning we took the machines back out and followed are trails in the snow.  We found some type of foot that was bigger than my dads.  To this day, after spending many years also in the Yellowstone area, after leaving the service and working for the West Yellowstone PD, and Gallatin County SAR, I cannot believe what I saw.  I have been on snowmobiles and in my truck driving the trails around the park for hunting or recreation and have seen many grizzlies of various colors, plus a bunch of elk, deer, and bison.

      "OBSERVED": "In February of 1984, I was wandering around an old junkyard with my best friend and three others (one girl and two other boys). My friend and I were both 14 at the time; the ages of the other kids ranged from 11 to 13. The junkyard was in an open area that was surrounded by a house and woods to the west, a rarely used railroad to the north, another house and Riley Rd to the south, and a very dense swamp to the east. I should note that the two houses were not easily visible from the junkyard: they were about 100 yards or more away. The junkyard was closest to the railroad and the swamp. The entire surrounding area was very sparsely populated--mostly woods and swamp. The junkyard was filled with old appliances (TVs, ovens, dryers, etc.), and furniture---as well as old magazines. My friend and I happened to find an old issue of Penthouse without the others seeing us, so we decided to go off and find a secret hiding place for our discovery. We headed off towards the woods and swamp to the east. We were just inside the woods near the swamp and we stopped to survey the immediate area for a good hiding place. I glanced down at the snow-covered ground near my friend's foot and immediately all the hair on my head and neck stood at attention. Right there, just inches from his boot was an incredibly huge \"human\" footprint. It was pristine. It was very fresh. It was about 18 inches long. The track looked completely normal except for it's size. Five toes, ball, arch, heel. Just like a bare footprint would look in the sand on the beach---except this one was in frozen snow. And it was about half to three quarters of an inch deep. Mine and my friend's tracks were barely visible---only a couple millimeters deep. (We each weighed about 150 to 160 pounds.) It was a right foot and there were no claw marks whatsoever ahead any of the five toes, as a bear track would exhibit. The ground around the track was patchy with frozen snow. There had been a thaw a few days ago, but now the weather had turned very cold again, but with no new snow, and the bare ground was quite frozen. I was quite knowledgeable--even at only 14 years old. I knew what to look for to determine a track's validity. I had spent the better part of my childhood in the woods---playing, hiking, exploring, etc. I knew the difference between fresh tracks and ones that had been distorted from melting. This one was definitely fresh. We looked for more tracks, but only found one other--about ten feet away---closer to the railroad. It was just outside the edge of the woods--also in snow and also a right foot. It was also about 18 inches in length. I also remember looking for hair samples, but to no avail. To this day I am still puzzled as to why we did not find any tracks of the left foot---and only found two tracks at that. The ground was frozen and the snow-covered areas were sparse near and in the swamp. It looked as if something/somebody came out of the swamp heading east and then turned, heading back into the swamp. We searched the surrounding area for more tracks, including several hundred yards of snow near the swamp's edge to the east and to the south, but found nothing. I really wanted to go into the swamp to look for more tracks, but it was nearly impenetrable. The swamp was filled with downed trees and overturned stumps. It seemed to me that we could only follow these tracks if we were either very tiny (like a squirrel) or very tall (say 8 or 9 feet) and very strong. We eventually gave up after several hours and headed back to my friend's house, which was about a half mile to the west. We told the others not to tell the adults as they would not believe us. Sure enough, neither sets of parents believed that we had encountered anything extraordinary, and did not want to be bothered with such nonsense. We never collected any evidence from the site--photographic or otherwise. To this day I have never returned.",

      "OBSERVED": "This is an older reporting. It was late spring or early summer of 2005. Located just 5-10 minutes south of Traverse City off a dirt road few miles off of Garfield rd. I was meeting up with a group of friends of mine on some Private property back in the woods. I was walking down a gated dirt road to meet with them in a spot we had found the summer before off of Arbutis lake. There we had come across previously while wondering through the woods was a hill that over looked the lake. You walked down the sandy bank that had erosion and you are at the waters edge, about 25 feet down. Any ways, i had just gotten out of work and it was around 5 or 6 o'clock pm and i had parked my car at the gate because it was locked. i continued to walk down the road. after about 10 minutes of walking i started to hear what sounded like sticks being banged together. knowing the camp site was relatively close, i thought it could have been my friends i was meeting up with getting fire wood, \"hey guys!\" i yelled out. no response, just the sound continuing, not skipping a sound... bang, bang about every second or so. \"hey you!\" i yelled thinking maybe its not them, but maybe some one else, still no response.. the sound continued. after my mind started wondering what it could have been, and knowing there was no houses for a decent walk away or so.. i decided i was going to just get out of there knowing i was alone. i quickly ran the last mile to the camp site. i stopped running once i approached the site, didn't want my friends to think i was scared in the woods by myself, i walked the last few hundred yards to the site. i didnt say anything to them about what had happened because they would have just thought i was joking. figured i would just let it sit, and do what i could so i wouldnt have to walk back to my car later alone. The night had gone on without any other occurance. until night had fallen and we were just sitting around talking. friend of mine and myself thought we would go and try to start a fire in a different location. as we proceeded to a different fire pit we had found on our previous visit there, we started gathering sticks and leaves to start a fire. as we were organizing the small twigs and leaves in the pit a small stick, 5-6 inches in length and about 2 inches thick came out of the dark woods and landed between us, bouncing and slid to a stop slightly behind our feet (as we wee kneeling side by side trying to get the sticks ready. we looked up and at each other. not having a flash light we assumed it was our other friend Phil, who always snuck off and tried to scare people. so we started to attempt to light the fire. before we got the match to the leaves another stick  (that we didnt find after it hit behind us) flew over our heads and landed in the woods behind us. \"Phil stop!\" my friend yelled. Phil replied \"doing what?\" from back at the other fire where we left him. we got up and walked back to the fire and told them what happened. why we called out Phil's name. They didnt believe us. so we ignored it. ten minutes later friend i was with lighting the fire (Kyle) and his girlfriend at the time went down to the water to swim. left Phil and i at the fire just talking about how he's looking forward to leaving for the army in the following months. Kyle started to freak out and yelled for us to grab the flash light. we grabbed it and jumped down the 4 foot erosion of roots and ran the distance down to the water. turned on the flash light to see a great amount of craw fish all gathered up in the shallow water. probably close to 30-40 pounds (if you were to catch and weigh them). they quickly mentioned how weird that was. As soon as that happened we heard a few thump noises through the ground up by the fire and heard the logs on the fire move... we ran back up the hill to the fire to find nothing. We looked for deer eyes with the flash light or any other eyes, nothing was there. by this time everyone was on edge. i decided to tell them my story from earlier that night, and we all decided that we were leaving, and we were leaving now. as we walked back nothing else had happened. no noises no smells nothing of that sort. just what had happened to us. then we all started to think... when we found that spot the summer before. there were people who did maintenance to it. cut the wild grass, had a hammock, and even had a few fire pits dug. water front camping, whats better? we all came to the conclusion, and the possible possibility, with what happened to us, what if that is the reason they dont camp there either. Years have gone by and i dont talk to any of them any more. we all went different paths. but i am sure that none of us have gone back there to camp.",

      "OBSERVED": "I have three encounters with what I believe to be Bigfoot or an unknown crpytid. 2008- In late fall I accompanied my wife, daughter, and my mother to stay in a rental cabin near island lake, situated near the manistee national forest in northern lower michigan.  As an avid mountain biker I brought along my bike and had planned several rides. The second day of my stay I set off on a ride about 6pm and entered a thick pine/cedar forest on what appeared to be a game trail. After roughly 1.5 miles of riding (I marked a way point on my GPS before entering the woods so I could easily find my way back) I noticed my front tire was very low on air. Shortly after I came to a very small clearing in the woods, it was clear cut purposefully with exposed stumps and new undergrowth. I set my bike against a pine stump and began to repair my front tire. To my right roughly 50-60 yards was a partially destroyed and burnt old RV. Seconds after glancing at it, a very loud thump came from within the camper. All I can describe it is as a \"head\" appeared in a broken window, which had to be over six feet from the base of the camper. From my distance all I could see was jet black fur and no noticeable ears, the eyes were not noticeable or black as well. It cocked its head to the right slightly as I mounted my mountain bike. I rode off quickly following my GPS map back to my starting point. Whatever it was I saw I believe followed me back to my cabin, as very foul and pungent odor lingered outside the next morning. 2009 For a short time while finishing my bachelors degree my wife and daughter lived with my dad. His house was at the end of a very long drive which backed up to hundreds of acres of woods and a large state recreation area called Waterloo in southern lower Michigan. After my parents divorced my mom who is a nurse moved in with her mother to provide care who lived right next door. December 3 I arrived home from school about 7pm. Shortly thereafter (I lived in an apartment in the basement) I hear a knock on the sliding glass door. It was my mother who looked very disturbed and frightened, and says she has been hearing howls all evening. I assumed coyotes as they were very abundant there. She was unshakeable in her opinion that it was not a coyote. I stepped outside onto the patio and shut off the exterior light. What I did notice immediately was a very strong odor being whirled around in the wind. I waited nearly 5 minutes and then I heard it, it was very near the tree line. Howling like I never have heard from a coyote, deep penetrating bass notes that sounded ragged and throaty. It was very windy and beginning to snow, and the howls seemed to occur in different locations. Due to the snow falling overnight no tracks or signs were observed.

      "OBSERVED": "It was Aug or Sept of 2011.  Warm night, around 3:30am.  We were raising broiler chickens (meat birds) in chicken tractors (mobile chicken coops).  Our bedroom window was open and I heard the sound of a squawking bird.  I jumped out of bed, grabbed the rifle (.22) and a Mykyta flashlight and ran outside--thinking coyote.  I shuffled down the slope behind our garage--toward the sound and toward the general area where the coops were--and paused at what I saw.  100 feet (I measured it the next day) ahead of me, and up the slope on the other side of this dip, was something--and I do not know what.  I shined the light on something that had huge orange eyes and was staring right at me--and standing over one of our chicken tractors.  I am guessing it was at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall, as I had my wife stand where it was the next day and she is about 5' 3\" and it was way higher than that (maybe 7?).  I just stood there and stared at it.  I could not make out the rest of its body size or shape.  We just stared at each other.  Seconds passed and I thought about firing at it, but my one neighbor to the south's house was right in line with him/it, and him/it being uphill of me, I'd be firing up, into the air, and toward homes--so I did not.  Also, my mind was swimming around trying to figure out what exactly I was looking at.  We continued to stare at each other.  I could see his eyes quite clearly, like detail of them.  Or so it seemed.  For whatever reason I decided to at least put the rifle in position to fire if need be.  It had been resting over my forearm, while I aimed the flashlight at it.  I took maybe 1 to 2 seconds, looking down at my hands as I positioned the rifle and flashlight together and lifted them--and he was gone.  I looked around all freaked out, didn't see him, so ran up the hill, just running forward, flashing the rifle and flashlight in all directions--all the time running south.  I quickly tuned into the sound of something crashing through the brush on my right.  It sounded like something sprinting through the thick bramble and saplings and I could hear it breathing, exerting itself--and moving very, very fast, to the SW.  I stopped and just listened to it until I couldn't hear it anymore.  It was running very fast--covering ground quickly.  Coming back to the chicken tractor, there was a pile of feathers sitting just outside the coop.  The bird (only one in there at the time) was fine, but missing many feathers from her rear end.  Usually, when a coyote gets them, or anything else, there will be digging of some kind.  There was none.  I went back inside and went to bed. This is the second odd encounter within maybe a 1-2 month window.  It was again around 3:30-4:00am.  I was sleeping and heard something screaming outside.  At the time we had multiple chicken tractors set up in three different locations to the south of our house, plus a chicken coop in the barn.  I assumed it was coyotes getting at the chickens and jumped out of bed, grabbed rifle and flashlight and this time ran out the front door--as it sounded like it might have been from the tractors best accessed that way.  I sprinted out, over to the birds, and they were all sleeping.  I then heard the screaming again and it was clearly coming from the west, over near the pig pens and barn.  The sound continued as I ran past the pig pen (no action--all asleep) and past the barn (coop secured and closed).  The screaming led off directly west.  It sounded like it was just beyond the barn and moving west.  Like, I ought to have seen it, but was running and unable to locate it with the flashlight.  I paused at the corner near the pig pen and barn and shined the light up the two-track directly west and saw two large, orange eyes aimed right at me.  I measured the distance the next day and it was almost 300 feet exactly (~290).  The eyes stayed put, staring right at me.  I felt no desire to shoot and based on my previous encounter felt like this might be a sasquatch and why shoot it?  We stared at each other for maybe a minute?  Then it calmly turned (to its left--my right) and disappeared.  I had zero desire to go after it.  I went back inside and went to bed.  The sounds I had heard were like...screeching/howling/wailings.  Loud!  Ape-like.  Like Animal Planet.  Like jungle ape sounds. Third report within about a 1-2 month period.  My family of four was out one evening doing animal chores (feeding, milking, watering).  It was around 8-9pm.  We'd gotten a late start on the chores.  It was already dark.  I was down near our pigs, my son was at the backdoor with the dogs, and my wife and daughter were in the barn milking and feeding goats.  I was filling a waterer when all of a sudden a loud, freakish howl/scream/wail began right over in the woods to the west of our barn.  I yelled out \"what is that?\"  My son yelled back \"I don't know!\"  It sounded like the wail from my previous sighting.  I dropped the hose and ran for the backdoor where the flashlight was, telling my son to put our freaking out dogs in the house.  I reached in, grabbed the flashlight and ran off into the woods.  All this time it was still wailing, and as I ran past the barn and up into the woods it had stopped.  I called my son to let the dogs out and they came out to me and tore into the woods.  They were gone about 3-4 mins and came back all excited but otherwise fine.  We all heard it, saw nothing, and wondered what it was.",

Our first exploration on the trip were the trails from the ranch to Traverse City.  We traveled through some forest to a high wire clearing that we felt had too much rugged terrain to continue.  We came to the first road in the high wire clearing and decided to turn around.  I was driving and my wife was riding in the passenger's seat. After turning around I looked across two hills from which we had just come and noticed what appeared on first impression, to be a cross country skier, 200 yards away, coming down the second hill away from us. Immediately many things bothered me about this cross country skier.  First, it was male and it was extremely tall, maybe 8 to 9 feet in height.  (It was very male because of its wide shoulder to slim waste shape)  Second, he appeared to traverse the steep down hill slope like a down hill skier attacking the slope in parallel skier motions but in very long foot steps instead of sliding skies in downhill parallel motion. No skies were noticed.  Third, and most puzzling, was that the figure was dark, dirty rusty, red from top of head to bottom of foot except for the face which was jet black. Finally the figure appeared very unnatural in movement. The entire sighting lasted a total of maybe 5 seconds. As I drove back over the area where I saw the figure I looked intently for cross country ski tracks.  I found none.  We also did not come across a skier and the area at the bottom of the hill dumped into a very thick wooded area blocked by a barbed wire fence. At the time I thought about stopping and looking for foot prints but was afraid of asking my wife if she saw what I thought I had just seen so I moved on. Whatever I saw bothered me all day.  Later in the evening I asked my wife if she noticed the cross country skier which I had seen. She had not seen the skier.  When I walked her through the event and told her that I think I saw a Bigfoot she just laughed and continues to laugh at me today. The sighting has continued to bother me over a month later.  I'm convinced that what I saw was too tall, was not clothed naturally, and moved too unnaturally to be a human.",

      "OBSERVED": "It was early april here in southern michigan, I was sitting watching tv around 2:30 AM and was preparing to go to bed when I felt like I was being watched. I live in a rented 12x70 2 bedroom trailer.   I was sitting at my pc looking across the room at the tv, when I felt odd and noticed in my peripheral vision that I couldn't see my neihgbor's outside light. That is when I turned to look straight out the window, the window was about 4 feet from me, and I found myself staring straight into the big , yellowed, bloodshot eyes of a sasquatch.  It looked like it was hairy all over -  I saw a hint of reddish, light brown colored hair on the forearm and shoulder.  The lighting on it was poor and I couldn't make out any facial features besides the eyes and it was staring right back at me. I have been living in this trailer for 6 months over winter months with no signs of anything strange going on around here. Well I jumped from my chair and threw off the blanket I had on my legs and stared right at it for a second and then realised my front door wasn't completely shut and locked.  I hurriedly reached for the handle to shut it and lock it and when the door handle met my hand, I tried to push it closed but it wouldn't move.  It was actually pushing the door open on me! After trying to move it, it wouldn't budge, so I gave in and sprinted to the back of my trailer and shut the bathroom door behind me and listened. I didn't hear anything actually enter the house, and after a few minutes of quiet, I exited the bathroom and entered my bedroom and got my gun and woke my wife. We both walked quietly back into the living room and the door was opened half-way, but there was no sign of it. I called a friend on the phone to come over to use his truck lights and my flashlights to search around but there was no more signs of it that night. The next morning I looked for tracks but there were none.  I did however find something like hairy, muddy fingerprints on the window pane.  I snapped a couple shots of it, and I stood where it was and determined the height to be around 8-81/2 feet tall. Since that night, both my wife and I have heard loud, mournful vocalizations in the middle of the night.  We have both gone out to investigate when we hear them and we hear loud, very large sounding \"things\" moving through the brush and weeds, shaking weeds, and we have smelled an awful, dead-skunk like smell on a couple of occassions in the early mornings. My friend and I have sat in a vehicle for a few hours in the early night, 11 PM-2 AM, and have heard brush and movement thru weeds attracting dogs close by to bark, and have had rocks or sticks thrown at the vehicle we are in. Also we were using a million candle spot that night we had stones thrown, and my friend swears he saw something \"manlike\" walking across our field of vision but we didn't get cameras or spot on it fast enough.That night I mention, which was 7-12-2006, was a full moon night so we had good night vision for a ways. My friend has also had large footprints in his driveway and has a local friend of his son has seen a pair of eyes, really high up and not very far away in the weeds while he and my friend's son and another boy were out jumping on a trampoline in the early evening one night 2 yrs ago and now he won't go out at night, and he is 16yrs old. My neighbors have been calling the police a couple of times a year, always in spring or summer, about \"someone\" or \"something\" walking and sneaking around their yard at night. This has been happening for about 8 yrs total now.  This property was all wood and scrub, and thick brush till around 8 yrs ago when the landowner cleared it up. The landlord's nephew said he saw a \"man\" walking through the yard around 11:30 AM 4 weeks ago and he thought it might have been me, but it wasn't.  We went to the area he saw it in during daylight and I was much shorter then what he saw. The landlord's wife was walking around a trailer in the middle of the property during the afternoon and felt like she was being watched and then she heard something very large run away through the brush just around the corner of a trailer where she was walking. This property is about 20 acres; he cleared about 10 of it and has 3 rental trailers on it.  I occupy one at the south end of the property, and he lives in one at the north end of the property.  The one in the middle is vacant, plus a couple of tool, supply  trailers(12x70 each) which he keeps shut and locked but the doors keep coming open and  there is some damage that we can't explain that looks like some of the siding was pried up or something tried to rip a piece off.  Also there are deep scratches around this piece of siding. The landlord and I have heard something tossing around some wood studs he has stacked up in the middle of his property and also we have heard what sounded like a long pipe thrown into weeds banging on a piece of wood. Since the first night I saw this big guy, I have heard it give out vocalizations like I have never heard before.  I have been an outdoorsman my whole life and I swear these were sounds like no other animal in this region would make.  Both my wife and I have heard what sounds like a pair of \"bigfeet\" walking thru woods by my house, dragging something and grunting back and forth at each other.  This occured around 5:45 AM. We hear it/them at least once a week, but around full moon times it seems to do more yelling and moving through brush when I go out to investigate.   I have tried vocalizing back from my front yard and both my wife and I heard something yell back across the field when I did it.  When my friend and I staked em out, just before we called it a day, I tried to yell a vocalization and that is when a few minutes afterwards I heard something in the brush and a rock hit the back of my van we were sitting in.  This was around 2:30 AM. [Edited]",

      "OBSERVED": "My father-in-law called me around 4pm on January 12, 2014 and told me he had went out to burn trash and found some strange tracks leading from the woods into his backyard in the snow.  I went over with my camera and a tape measure to see what it was.  Until yesterday we had about 15 inches of fluffy snow on the ground.  Yesterday it had warmed up and rained and we lost about 7 inches of that snow so I thought that the tracks were probably just a deer or dog and between the rain and melting snow the tracks had appeared larger than they really were.  When I got there I was first impressed with the size of the tracks.  It was definitely not a deer or dog.  I began taking pictures of the tracks and have several pictures of them.  I also measured the tracks which measured 17.5 inches long.  What really impressed me was the stride between steps.  All of them were at least 2.5 - 3 feet apart and several were more including one that I took a picture of, with the tape measure in the picture with a stride of 4.5 feet.  My father-in-law is 6'2\" and he could not duplicate the stride especially with the snow on the ground.  Also, he wears a size 13 boot and his tracks were not near as big and wide as these were.  I have pictures with the tape measure for reference to show the size and stride of the tracks and steps.  We followed the tracks into the woods and they lead to a ridge that dropped almost straight down approximately 100 - 120 feet to a creek bottom.  Whatever made the tracks actually walked straight up that ridge and you can see the tracks in the pictures I took.  We couldn't do it because we just kept losing our traction and slipping.  The tracks never slipped.  This thing walked straight up the ridge without missing a beat.  The deer tracks and coyote tracks all went along the ridge but nothing else walked straight up it.  No human could have done that especially with all the snow we had, not to mention I don't know any human with a 17.5 inch track and 4.5 foot stride.  Also, beside one of the trees that the tracks went by there was an area about 3 feet in diameter that was yellowish brown.  It appeared to be urine.  I collected a sample of the yellow snow and put it in a plastic container and put it in my freezer.  My wife and I own an assisted living home for elderly and developmentally individuals.  We are well known in our community and I am known for my honesty.  I am not trying to get attention or make up some far fetched story.  I don't know what exactly made these tracks but it was something large and heavy and did things that I don't believe any human I know could do.",

It appeared to me the thing had been running and maybe slowed down.  As it came out into the opening and saw me it leaped or ran across the road into the heavy thicket.  It was traveling from west to east.  As I approached where it had crossed it had already disappeared into the thick woods and brush.  I didn't look for tracks because I was so taken back by what I had just seen. Up until this time I had never believed in bigfoot or sasquatch.

      "OBSERVED": "When I was a child we used to go to Caseville every summer and rent a cabin on the Lake Huron shore. I believe I was 12, my sister 5, which would make it 1965 when this occurred. One night there was a \"weenie roast\" on the beach, and all the families were invited to meet on the beach that night. Usually the beach was deserted at night. The moon was full that night. I was standing by the campfire with a group of kids when a boy and girl came running up, and the boy was ranting and shaking and wild eyed with fright. He said \"we were attacked by a witch-(remember as you read this these are all kids talking)\"there's a witch in the sand dunes, it had set a trap and tried to grab us\" He then proceeded to tell us that they had been walking in the dunes and had fallen into a hole that had purposely been covered with branches. Just as they were climbing out of the \"trap\", a \"witch\" came towards them and they ran. We were all laughing and refusing to believe them, but I remember looking closely at him and he was really scared, breathing hard. He was adamant he was telling the truth, so we kids decided to go into the dunes to find the witch, and to go in pairs from different points. I was climbing the path up into the dunes with another girl, and as the path was steep, I was looking down to watch my footing. Suddenly I heard a rumbling like a small motorcycle motor above me. My 1st thought was that a mini bike was coming towards us on the trail, but when I looked up, I saw this \"thing\" standing 8 feet or so in front of me, facing us, and realized the sound was growling. The full moon was lighting it up from behind and to the side. My companion let out a gasp and immediately ran away, and at 1st I froze, but then I just smirked and thought, \"I get it, this is a joke, the kid got us up here, now he's got a friend who's trying to scare us.\" The creature was about 4 feet tall, and had massive shoulders like a football player with their shoulder pads on. It was standing up right, but appeared hunched forward at the shoulders, appeared to have no neck, and a relatively small and perfectly round head. Due to the moon being behind it I could not see the lower 2/3rds of the head nor could I see the face at all. I really tried to see the face, too, but it was totally dark. From the massive shoulders, it narrowed into a relatively small waist with short (comparatively)stocky legs bent at the knees, and big feet. The chest was smooth and looked at 1st like leather, but I realised I could see muscle outlined. The arms were longer than would be proportionate for a human, hung down to it's knees, and the hands were long and large. He was facing me swinging his arms side to side, right left, and had stopped growling but was kind of grunting.( I say he as it was very masculine looking.)It was covered with orange hair. As I studied it, I realized I could see veins, tendons, hairs coming out of skin. I began to realise this thing was real not a costume. I saw what looked like about 1 inch long claws, clearly lit by the moon. I realised this thing was real, had started walking towards me, and had claws and a jolt of fear kicked me into gear and I ran. I know you say these animals don't have claws, but I saw claws, that's what made me panic. I am open to the possibility they were long fingernails. As I was running, I remember being so afraid it was going to grab me, as it was coming slowly towards me and was only about 6 feet or so away when I ran. When I got down the dune onto the beach near a group of people I immediately turned and looked up the hill, but could no longer see anything there in the darkness of the hill. I was so shocked I said nothing, and never saw any of those kids again. They must've run home. I remember thinking how grateful I was that it didn't grab me, and also wondered why it didn't,when it seemed to be coming towards me. Within a matter of minutes, my little sister (age 5) came down from the side of the same sand dune towards me, saying \"I saw Frankenstein and the wolfman.\" I ran over excited and said \"Did you see it?\" Now, years later as an adult, she swears she saw it too. What had happened was she wanted to follow the other kids into the dunes, but instead of taking the path, she climbed through the grass up the side of the dune. She says that she was at the top, just below the path, when a set of little feet ran by. (the 1st girl) A few seconds later, a second set of feet (me) and then this \"ape\" came down the path and stopped in front of her. She was viewing it from the side, which was dark as the moon was on the other side of it. She only remembers the arms swinging, the grunting, and hairy hands and feet. She felt it appeared brown, but again she wasn't seeing it from a vantage point that would illuminate it like I did. She tells me she was right next to it, and she could have touched it's ankle if she wanted to. She yelled down to our mother that there was something up there, and my Mom replied something like \"That's nice dear,\" and kept socializing. She tells me due to the yelling she's sure the thing knew she was there, right next to her, but it did not hurt her,threaten her, or touch her. When I asked her what her impression was, she felt that it seemed bewildered, confused, like it didn't know what to do. I tried to tell my parents but they wouldn't believe us. I was so afraid to sleep that night, as our cabin was mere yards from the path the encounter occurred on. However, nothing else occurred. I have a cousin who's family used to own a lake front vacation house in Caseville when she was very small. They had a swamp directly behind their house, and their housekeeper (who is now deceased) used to tell them \"There's something in that swamp.\" When I 1st started researching on the internet what I'd seen, I didn't think \"Bigfoot\",as it looked so different from the descriptions I'd heard and the photos I'd seen. However, now I know there are different varieties of \"bigfoot\", and in fact my sighting looks very similar to the drawing on the cover of the \"Legend of Boggy Creek\" video ",

If you take walks at night along the woods line you can hear something walking beside you in the woods but it never comes out. There is sometimes an awful screaching noise as well. One night me and my boyfriend were outside and we heard something walking in the woods (our house was about 20 feet from the woods line) and we stopped to listen. It sounded like something scared whatever it was because it sounded as if something large holding a 2x4 horizontally went crashing through the woods. It was so loud and moving fast. A few weeks later we were outside and we heard some cracking in the woods and then it sounded like whatever it was stepped on one of those old glass coke bottles and broke it. Now a woodland animal wouldnt be able to do that. It's been reported around our area that there are \"monkey people\" living out in the woods. Many people have come back with tales of seeing strange ape-like creatures while hunting. My mother and sister went outside one night and saw 2 big red eyes sitting under the apple tree they have near the woods. It took off running and my mom said it looked ape-like. She even says that she was driving home one day and looked off in toward the ditch and saw what she claims was a large silver looking ape-creature. She said she was too scared to stop so she kept going. I'm not sure what it is but I know that since I was a little girl we'd hear things out there. My dad is a sceptic and even he admits there's something there. People come over late at night to just walk the woods line to see if they can hear anything.

I was fishing one day and I was all alone because I walked up and down the river for almost a mile and a half. I was fishing and all of a sudden a huge rock hit the water like 50 feet down from me and make quite a big splash. This is in the Whittemore Area, and I looked down the river and then this big giant apelike creature looked out over the river at me and literally scared the crap out of me it had really long hairy arms and big broad shoulders and the head on this thing was way bigger than a human. The creature stood at least 11' in the air. Then it turned and started walking into the woods, but it walked toward me. it made like 5 steps and stopped. When it walked you could hear the sticks and leaves cracking under its feet. It got quiet but too quiet. Even the birds stopped chirping. It was getting scary. So I packed up my fishing gear and started walking curiously toward the trail. I was yelling into the woods and asking \"Is there anybody there?\" but nobody answered so I started walking down the trail. on the quarter mile back to the main road. I started walking back and then I kept getting this feeling that someone was watching me or something. I turned around and as I turned around this big giant thing jumped over this barbed wire fence and ran up the hill leaving this big stump swaying aggressively. It was up and over the hill in like 5 seconds. This thing was freaken Fast! I ran up the hill but on the other side was a big field. It was gone by then. I later bumped into my Aunt my brother and my cousin. They said that they heard something walking up by this pond then they heard a low growl and then it walked away.

We walked toward the figure I noticed it was still near the tree bent over slightly almost like it was trying not to be noticed. We both ran back to the garage and talked about what we saw and decided we didn't know what it was mostly because of its size and the way it moved. When we got back to the garage we both said how hard our hearts were beating it was truly a scary experience. My daughters name is Madison we talked about it for a long time that night and tried to come up with an animal it could have been but could not.

      "OBSERVED": "This incident happened to me during the november deer hunting season of 1996. I was deer hunting on state ground that lies in back of our cabin in Iron county in Michigan's U.P. It is very rugged country with only a few foottrails that we keep open for access. The land is a mixture of high rock hills with very thick pine and hardwoods with dense swamps and small streams and creeks running through it, along the rivers are very thick tag alders which make the area outstanding for deerhunting. One evening when I was walking back to camp which was approx. 2 miles away I came around a bend in the trail and saw about 50 yds. in front of me a silhouette of what looked like a very large man in the middle of the trail. The ground was covered with about 6 in. of snow along with the trees so I could make out this dark silouette very well. I thought it was one of my buddies so I said fairly loud\" so, what did you see!\". Immediatly it turned and stepped across the trail and into the bush with no noise whatsoever. I stood there dumbfounded and scared for about 5min.Before I worked up the nerve to walk up the trail to where I had seen it,as this was the only way back to the cabin. I walked up to and past the spot where it was with my rifle leveled and the saftey off hoping not to see it again. I never did, it had just vanished without a sound. I hurried back to camp and never mentioned it to anyone.I went back the next day to look for sign of any thing but about 4in. of snow fell that night and I couldn't find anything. Over the years I've played this over in my head and the only thing I can come up with is that that for a brief instant I was talking to a bigfoot who didn't want to talk back.",

We were the last to leave. We backed out of the drive, lights still off so as to not flash them into the neighbor's trailer. As I headed towards M-20, I reached for the lights... at the same time, we all spotted a large striding figure approaching the road from the east. The fluid motion of the creature stunned me and I only managed to turn on the parking lights before it took two strides and passed directly in front of the car. I had jammed on the brakes and came to a stop. In three more strides the creature stood across the road where a trail led into the woods (behind the church on the corner). It's eyes glowed green at us as it paused to stare a moment, and then turned into the woods. Stunned, we sat frozen, and then someone said \"floor it...\". I did, and we stoppped at the intersection and looked at each other. I turned the lights on and we agreed we had all seen \"something\", but would discuss it later. The creature stood between 6'5\" and 7'5\" tall, was dark brown in color, had course hair, and a rounded head. The massive ARMS swung at its sides as it walked and it's strides were nearly 8 feet apart. I later measured the site and estimated the strides. We all agreed on the color, height, eye color, head, and strides. It's left hand had been placed on the hood of the car as we surprised this animal...it hurried to cross the road...it's hand was at the level of the hood. So as to not collaborate a story, we all wrote down what we had seen and then compared...that was two weeks later. This was no fabrication, and no halucination. What stirred us from our silence was a report for this county a few years ago, listed here on your site under Isabella Co., Mi., we heard it on the radio and were amazed. The site they reported, on Leaton Road, was only two miles away from our encounter site. Their report was dismissed as \"unreliable\", but the coincidence was too strong. I have a degree in Sociology and Anthropology from Central Michigan University, and I DID NOT take our incident lightly.  P.S. Incidently, the trail leading into the woods follows a power line clearing that skirts houses all the way to Leaton Rd., and then crosses to the north. Is this coincidental also?",

The other side of the river is heavily wooded lowlands. As our dog was doing his business, we heard what almost sounded like a gorilla grunt, approximately 75 feet from me on the edge of the river on the other side. About 45 seconds later we heard another and my dog literally dragged me to the house. Up on the deck we could hear something very large crunching through the branches on the other side of the river keeping pace with us. I walked back to the other end of the deck to see if it would change direction and follow me back and it did. All of a sudden we heard a loud crack like a large branch was broken, followed by a large splash. I heard it take about 3 steps in the water, then climb back out of the water onto the bank and it through a rock across the river. I could hear the water dripping from his fur, once again my dog freaked out and dragged me back to the door of the house. I heard what sounded like a shaggy dog shaking the water off, followed by a really strange snort and then heard him crunch through the underbrush walking away from the river. It was too dark to see across the river, but whatever fell in the river was very large (too big to be any dog) and bears are currently in hibernation. The next morning I looked across to the other side of the river where all the activity was and there is an old rotten tree stump that was split in half to the ground with the broken half laying right at the edge of the river.

I just want to let you know what I have experienced and it could be nothing at all. I have NEVER in my life read about signs of a bigfoot or anything of the kind so I don't know what to look for, but it occurred to me that something odd is going on in the woods behind my house in Northern Michigan (my summer home). Upon arrival to Michigan for the summer, I walked around the back of my house via my wraparound porch and smelled such a pungent aroma kind of like a sulfer/waste smell mixed with the strongest male body odor I have ever encountered. It was about 50 degrees outside and I could not get over the strong smell which literally overwhelmed me. The home has been vacant for months and noone would have been near the house in the preceding days of our arrival. It smelled like a man, but more like a poopy body odor but literally ten times stronger. My house is located on a cul de sac with only 2 other homes on it both at least 100 yards and 200 yards away. Our lot is big about 1-1/2-2 acres with woods on 3/4 and the 3rd hole of the golf course on the other 1/4. The woods however are quite thick and have lots of deer and turkey etc. The next day I went outside again early in the morning and smelled it again so strongly. The smell actually lasted around 2 1/2 days and then finally went away. Keep in mind that the house has been vacant for over 9 months until we arrived. Then 2 nights ago my husband and I heard a deep-throated moan or sream kind of like an animal dying but it didn't sound like an animal and it didn't sound human either. Strangest thing ever.",

I usally took back roads as it was faster than driving out of the way to get on the interstate.  On several occasions in the area know as Gooselake, Michigan. On Gooselake road, I observed a big creature cross the road in front of me. Approximately 20 feet in front of me. Upright, Redish in color, and tall. Maybe 7 to 8 feet. The first time I saw it I wasn't sure that I wasn't sleepy or my eyes playing tricks on me.  The next week when I went through there I was going slower and watching for it.I was paying close attention and there it was again. On the side of the road  with what looked like road kill or something.  It was smelling this thing and examining it very carefully.  I sat in the middle of the road (in my car) for about three minutes when it gets up and starts walking towards my truck. I was about 30 feet away this time. When it got within ten feet I started backing up to keep a distance between me and it. It was dead on in my headlights.  I could see it had sexual organ (male). This wasn't anyone wearing a costume. It scared the the living daylights out of me. I backed up a liitle farther and it stopped coming towards me. It just turned away and walked down into the ditch at the side of the road and walked into the woods. I stepped on the gas and got out of there. I never took that road again.

      "OBSERVED": "I was around 12 years old and watching my 4 younger brothers one evening while my parents went out for a few drinks when I heard something that scared me like nothing else I have ever experienced before or since.  It scared me so badly in fact that I was too embarrassed to ever mention it to my parents, certain that they would merely ridicule me for lack of any evidence to back up such a wild and unprovable claim. I had sent my brothers all to bed an hour or so before and had been lying on the living room couch watching television around 11pm when I heard a noise outside the window the couch was situated under.  It was quite loud and extremely close, just outside the window against the side of the house... close enough that I could hear an intake of breath from the source of the sound. I was horribly frightened by the sound, because I had never heard anything like it in my entire life.  It was a howling scream that sounded like something dying and it gradually shifted to a gurgling chuckle or laugh-like sound that lasted maybe around 10 seconds. It did not repeat and no other sound were heard. I have heard many screams from human and animal sources including rabbits, deer, dogs, cats, racoons and possums but this sounded nothing like any of them even remotely, and I certainly never heard anything besides another human produce a true laugh. What I heard did not sound human at all, it actually sounded \"evil\" to me, for lack of a better description, and it scared me so badly that I waited around 30 minutes before mustering enough courage to don boots, jacket and grab a flashlight to go outside and investigate. It was mid-winter and had been snowing since early evening so there was several inches of fresh snow on the ground but after searching all around our house and yard I could not find a single track to indicate what had caused the sound. There is a gap between houses where the sound came from that is maybe 12-15 feet wide with a shrub-line roughly 6 feet from the side of our house, and all the snow was totally undisturbed. This really upset me, because I had been hoping that maybe a boy that lived a few doors down at that time had somehow come over and created the noise as a prank to frighten me, even though I found it nearly impossible to convince myself that the sound could be made by a human, nor reproduced so realistically by any portable recording devices available to teens in the early 1970's. Talking myself into thinking it a prank had been how I managed to dredge up enough courage to go outside and investigate in the first place... so now I was truly frightened and immediately went back in the house and stayed there until my parents returned home. I never associated this event with bigfoot until a few days ago as I was reading a few bigfoot sighting reports on the net, merely as a lark, and was amazed at how similar some of the sounds reported fit the description of what I heard that night. In fact, just reading some of the descriptions has caused me to relive a little of the terror I experienced so many years ago... and I'm not a person that has ever had any phobias or natural fears. The scream was frightening, but nearly as terrifying as the inhuman laugh it became before tapering off. I saw the term \"diabolical\" used to describe a sound heard by someone filing a report and I have to totally agree that this is maybe the most apt description I could ever imagine of the sound I heard that night. I do not mind whether what I say here is ever believed or dismissed as false, I merely wanted to get the information across in the hopes that somebody else has reported something similar at that same place and time in history and what I report might possibly add a little more information to clarify other more credible and evidenced events that others might report.",

Teens would frequently drive back on the little two-tack dirt roads in the area as a way to entertain and scare each other while looking for the melonheads.

Well, I have an honest to God true story to tell, and then let your readers decide how possibly there might be a Bigfoot in our very own area. One night, about 38 years ago, my sister-in-law and I went to visit a friend in Three Lakes.  On our way home I was driving, and not but a few miles from our friend's home, which was on the highway, upon the arisen (sic) to the left, this massive white creature came to the top of the hill, and we looked at each other in disbelief as to what we were seeing. We said to one another, \"Oh, my God.  What the heck is that?\"  We freaked out.  I slowed some and kept looking at this huge white furry creature looking down toward us.  We just kept repeating to ourselves as to what we were seeing. I could understand some people saying, 'Oh yeah, they were drinking.\"  Maybe so, but all we drank were numerous cups of coffee as we visited our friend. As we drove in a rather hurried pace, rather shook up, we sped.  Unknown to myself at the time I had passed a police car, didn't realize it until we saw the emblem on the door.  My sister-in-law said, \"My gosh, now we passed a cop to boot.\"  We kept talking all the way home, wondering and questioning ourselves as to what we saw and if it was possible that it truly was this giant white furry Bigfoot as we like to call it. We have told numerous people our story and everyone kind of just says, 'Yeah, right,' and laughes at us, but we will stake our lives on this story and we will go to our graves knowing what we saw was \"Bigfoot or Loch Ness.\"",

Myself and a friend (Adam) decided to go fishing for bass.  We were in the cove for some time; since it was a full moon we did not bring a flashlight.  Around the midnight hour we hear this \"ROAR\" come from the shore line which was black due to the thick woods and we were on the water; within seconds something splashed into the water about 10 feet or less from the boat!  We were both pretty startled and speechless we just started the motor and headed back to the lodge \"Paradise Lodge\".  Of coarse we were teased about it and Adam would not even say a thing.  The following day another friend (Joe) and myself went in search of anything.  We had to go by boat to get to the area where \"ROAR\" came from.  It was known as the hunting club property and my first time there; as far as I know there were no buildings, but plenty of cover and trails which we walked on from the shore and came upon a small pond with slight incline banks of sandy ground.  To our findings, we did find very large foot prints, you could make out the toes as they were heading up the incline from the water.  Then on our way back to the shore and the boat my friend Joe got a little ahead of me and to my right was a thicket that you could not even see anything in this area, that is when I heard a limb snap scaring the heck out of me so much I could not even call out to Joe; I just froze in my steps.  Looking into this thicket as hard I could without seeing anything.  Then we left and that was pretty much the end of it.

After doing this for some time we stopped and looked around for some reason.The opposite side of the wood lot was not vary far away and the sun was bright. What we saw was a huge man standing broad side to us looking at us. He was huge and as we looked he turned and walked away. We flew out of the woods and told our mothers but they just said it was the neighbor man. Well it was not a man. We never went into that section of woods again.

While we were sitting  at our campfire, we heard this mournful wail just outside the light of the campfire behind one of the campers. Next there was what sounded like a low growl then a sort of howl yelping sound, we all went for flashlights and stopped dead in our tracks when we heard the sounds of trees being snapped and branches breaking. We changed from flashlights to rifles as the growling increased. We stood there looking out into the dark for what seemed like 20 min or so then the sound started moving away deeper into the woods. At daybreak we ventured out towards where the sounds were coming from and found several small trees snapped and bushes uprooted. There were what could have been footprints but the ground was so tore up, it was impossible to tell what kind they were. Later that morning a friend of mine was out scouting for a place to put his blind and he came across a huge mound of earth that looked as though it was just piled there. He called the camp on his walkie talkie and told us to come out to where he was we could find him by following his trail markers into the woods going south off the logging road. When we got to him he was pointing his rifle towards some thickets of tag alder saying that when he approached the huge pile of sand and earth he heard the same sounds that we had heard the night before coming from that direction.To make a long story short we contacted the DNR in Harrisvile and an officer came out upon examining the dirt mound several mutilated deer and some wild blackberry bushes were buried in it. Again the ground was tore up so bad that no distinguishing footprints were apparent. The DNR officer said that what we had in the area was most likely a big bear. We have used that site ever since and have never encountered anything like that year again. We still talk about it over the campfire though.",

      "OBSERVED": "Younger Brother: In 1992-93 we went to visit family friends.  And when playing outside us kids built a tent-like fort over the clothesline.  With sheets and clothespins.  Then later when were called in for dinner we went in and ate.  Then watched a movie.  And as now it was late we decided to leave on wishing us farewell the owner of the house saw the fort with her sheets still up and said \"no one is going anywhere until those sheets are in the house\". So me being little I got out of the work and got to sit in the van with my mom. Who turned on the head lights so they did not have to dismantle the fort in the dark.  As we are watching this my mom says \"hey do you see that shadow over there by the tree?\"  and I tried to look but could not make it out.  so she took a flash light and shined it in the vicinty but not directly on it hoping not to spook whatever it was that was only 20-30 feet from the kids and the clothesline.  she asked me again if i couls see that thing just standing there watching the kids take down the tent-fort. when i said no she called over my big brother who instantly saw what she was talking about. And in his excitement he grabbed the flash light ran towards it. and i will let him take it from here. Older Brother: I approached the clothes line and held the light on the trees just beyond us and never did shine the light on this shadow figure due to i was afraid too. But what i remember from then was seeing the out line of a dark colored figure. It was adifferent shade  than the tree bark. it was near 6 in a half feet tall or maybe 7 feet. I was about 5'9\" at the time and i felt very short upon seeing this shadow next to the tree about 20 feet from me and my sister and her friend. We all saw this outline of a tall man near that tree when i told the girls that there was something by that tree watching us. It never moved from its position by the tree it stood up right and just seemed to watch. We hurried quickly and gathered the sheets off the line and i threw them in a bag and gave them to the friend as i was scared and so was my sister. We ran to the van and she got in first and i followed. My seat in this van was not a normal seating position. My folks had installed another van seat in the van that faced out the back window. This was the seat i took and sat in this night. Mom backed down the drive way. As she turned on the road the head lights passed over the spot where the figure had stood and everyone but me at this time say they saw the what looked like a upper body shape or a set of shoulders that where large. Mom started to drive forward towards Wadena and as we pulled away from this sighting of this shadow and figure. I watched in terror as i saw it running down the tree line towards the road we were on heading home. I told mom to drive faster and to this day she claims she was doing about 30 miles an hour on this dirt road. I watched this thing take and turn at the ditch and run real fast and real close to our van it had kept up for the first half a mile. Before it must have given up on following us anymore. It never ran on the road it stayed in the ditch and was fast. It didnt pump its arms when it ran like a sprinter does. The arms of this beast swung long and almost like with ease right in stride with its long stride as it kept up very well with the van. I know it didnt run like a mile or anything but it was almost a half mile that it did and never lost speed or footing in its steps as it chased us. Younger Brother: I would like to add someting now to my brothers discription. First off will never forget the feeling of not knowing what was going on when he hurried and took down the fort quickly.  I could tell he was scared and remember very clealy as he ripped the sheets off the line the clothespins popping up in the air madly.  I knew something was wrong,  I was eight or so and this was my big brother.  Nothing scared him.  He was like the strongest person knew. And when my brother said it was chasing us his seat faced the back but I turned over the second seat and you could see it plainly in the red light provided by the tail lights.  There was a shadow on two legs not more than ten feet from us running in the ditch after the van.  It was very fast and especially for its size.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "yes,  about a week or so before my mom and i were driving to the same house.  and on the way there as we approached a hill i saw what i thought was a skunk run across the road.  but it was a steep hill and after cresting it.  when i looked in the direction it was running in there was a corn field probably 50 yards long.  when we got to the field there was a path recently knocked down about 4-5 ft. wide.  all the cobs were on the stocks and it just looked trampled over all the way through.  cause i could see the barn just like looking down a hallway.  from the moment i saw the \"thing \" cross the road to when we got up to it lasted probably 4-5 seconds.  my mom and i got out and inspected the corn and it was just trampled over.",

      "OBSERVED": "Around 1989, I was home from college for a weekend in the Spring--April or May--with my best friend, and since we were looking for a little cash to earn, my parents hired us to clean out the garage of boxes, paper, etc.  We decided to get my dad's tractor and hook the wagon up to it, throw the garbage in and haul to a burning pile we used to burn brush, and now the contents of the garage--this burn pile is about 200-250 yards from the house next to a woods that my parents owned.  Next to the woods has always been a farm field, usually grown with alfalfa and around 150 acres; leading up to the brush pile is long, tall grass with sparse trees here and there with an old barn and old house nearby (both abandoned).  We worked through the afternoon cleaning the garage, getting a sizable load on the wagon until it over flowing.  We decided to finally go down to the pile, dump off what we had and leave the remaining garbage for another trip once we got the fire going.  It was beginning to get dark as my friend and I took the tractor and wagon to the pile, unloaded it, and started a very big fire (with my parents’ permission).  Both of us stayed and unloaded the entire trailer and made sure it wasn't going anywhere--I remember vividly that it was dead calm that evening.  I asked my friend if he thought one of us should go get the remaining garbage, which was agreed upon, and somehow I was the one to go back with the tractor while he stayed back to tend the fire.  I suppose I was gone at most, 20 minutes to half hour, and returned.  I shut off the tractor and threw a few things on the fire and decided to take a break.  As I was standing there next to my friend I didn't give it much thought, but he was very quiet and seemed almost serious.  Suddenly, I heard a sound like someone (thing) was running around the perimiter of the fire and us just far enough out of the light of the fire to see any movement.  I looked at my friend and said something like \"Did you just hear that?\"  He replied, \"Since you left, I have been hearing very strange noises all around me, and I have standing as close to the fire as possible\".  I could see that he was visibly shaking and had definite \"fear\" in his eyes.  That is when trees started breaking in the woods, and I'm not talking about a twig breaking, it sounded like limbs from the trees were being torn out of the trunks, and becoming more and more frequent and increasing in size.  At that point, we began hearing the \"running\" again--this time, it was multiple \"things\" running and at a speed that no human could run--at least myself, and I was an athlete then-- they were \"heavy\" sounding.  We both looked at each other and didn't want to be there any more--fire watch or no fire watch.  We decided the only thing to do at this point just to feel safe was throw more boxes and stuff on the fire to keep whatever was messing with us at bay.  As we were throwing garbage on the fire, I happened to look up, beyond the fire, and saw this dark, black \"figure\" deftly moving along the perimeter of the woods and suddenly duck back into the woods--at most, 100 yards away.  I said, \"Forget it! Get on the tractor, we're getting out of here!\"  I started the tractor, and my friend instinctively grabbed the pitchfork with us, jumped on the wagon and basically guarded us if something was to \"attack\", which didn't happen.  We didn't go back that night.  I did return the following morning to make sure the fire was out, which it was.  I also went into the woods to see if I could find any tracks but there were so many leaves that I found nothing.  The fields too, had growth on them and were hard packed.  I purchased the land about 8 years ago from my mom, and I spend a lot of time up there cutting wood and playing around with my kids, friends and relatives; and every time I drive by the perimeter of the woods, I think to myself, from the distance that figure had to be 7-8 feet tall, maybe taller--and quick.  My friend and I are still best friends and do a lot together, and when we're alone, we talk about that event occasionally and both of us still get a little rattled about that evening, because we still feel like we were intentionally chased out of there, possibly because of the fire? Warmth? Abandoned buildings to nest in?  We still ponder those variables. When this happened, it was so weird that I can’t explain—these beings were like goblins.  They intentionally did things by making us think that there isn’t something ordinary about this evening.  They didn’t need to attack us to get us to leave, just break some branches and run around us; however, this was enough to paralyze us with fear.  Let’s be honest, when night falls, humans are severely limited in our faculties:  we can’t see in the dark—are dependent on light, and really cannot function in any remote behavior like these beings.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "Wish i knew what to look for, but looked for the tree branches broken--however, I looked for branches snapped off trees--in the spring after winter, there is brush and branches everywhere so i thought something like this looking for a needle in the haystack..

Close to the mouth of the Big Sucker river. I had to stop the truck as we approached a very old bridge that had been washed out years before. We were deep into the woods at this point. The nearest house was probably 4 miles away, close to highway 61. I had never been this far on this trail by truck, however, I have hunted grouse in this area on foot before, sometimes walking for hours. We got out of the truck and walked over to the small broken down bridge and looked around, no way to get across so we started talking and etc. All of a sudden we heard a series of screams and howls in the area across the bridge from us. \"It\" was getting closer and louder. Being a woodsman, I checked the wind and observed that the wind was blowing our scent toward the screaming and howling entity. We could hear crashing and breaking of large branches together with the terrible screams and decided that it had zeroed in on us and that we had better get the hell out of there, fast! The hairs on my arms stood up and my adreniline kicked in. Both of us ran to the truck and locked the doors. I rolled down my window on the driver's side as I was turning the truck around and I could still hear the thing coming closer. I could not see too far into the thick brush but I knew that it was close. We finally got the truck turned around on the narrow one-lane road and fled. My friend was so afraid that she didn't want to ever talk about it again. I am a native of Northern Minnesota and I have hunted, fished, and hiked many areas up there and I have never heard anything like that before. I was also trained as a big game guide in Montana and no animal fits this description that I know of. I now live in Auburn, Washington and still do some exploring up in the mountains near Greenwater. I am armed when I venture up into the hills now, not only with a pistol but with my camera. Another thing that I might mention is that I recently heard a recording of Bigfoot on the radio one night that made me get goose bumps all over again.

This occured at 9:00pm-10:00pm, during the month of July, in 1977 or 1978. There was a total of one witness. I am twenty three years old now. Said incident occured when I was approximately five or six years old. I feel I have good reason to believe strongly in my story. There is no explanation, other than this memory, of why I've spent so much time reading about and researching the subject. Also, there's the feeling I get when I'm in the woods. Kind of like I'm not really alone. Which is not to say that I feel that there is a sasquatch in the woods wherever I go, it's just the knowledge that there is something else \"there\" in general. Please take this message seriously as I have never come across anyone with as strong a conviction on the subject as myself. I would enjoy going into greater detail about my sighting if you all feel it's worth following up.",

      "OBSERVED": "In May of 1986, three friends and me went canoeing in the Boundary Water's Canoe Area Wilderness in Northeastern MN (St. Louis County). We had originally planned on doing a loop trip; beginning and ending at Moose River parking lot off the Echo Trail (County Rd 116). We had never gone canoe tripping before, although all of us had done extensive backpacking and were experienced woodsman. We ended up taking way too much gear, but being stubborn Air Force guys (stationed at Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota), we assumed we could overcome it. We ended up spending the night on Lake Agnes, on the peninsula on the northwest side. Due to poor planning, our site got raided by several marauding bears, which really messed things up. The next morning, the rangers asked us to depart the area. Since we were on leave, and had worked hard planning the trip, we agreed, but planned another route. We ended up portaging a mile into Ramshead Lake, approximately 2.5 miles southwest of Lake Agnes. We got in around 6 at night and set up camp and make dinner.  The next day, everyone was bushed, but I wanted to go visit a nearby waterfall. So I took the canoe and paddled across the lake to Meander Creek, which flowed into the west side of Ramshead Lake. I ended up disappointed as there was very little water over a small cascade. I was just relaxing when I heard footfalls in the area. At first I thought it was a moose or a deer, but the sounds appeared to be very close and circling me. I thought this was odd, but was not overly concerned until I heard the sound of something hitting a tree with another log. The crack startled me and I jumped. Then the sound moved away and to my left, about 100 yards upstream. Another crack and I hit the path back to my canoe and returned quickly to the island. My friend Rick was sleeping and Roy and his son Ken saw me hustling and asked me what was up. I stammered that there was something out there, and I was a bit nervous. I didn't want to lose face, so I minimized it. Roy asked me to explain myself, but I couldn't articulate what had happened. I finally told him what I heard, so being the more mature and higher ranking person, he jumped in the canoe, while rousting everyone to follow him to show the \"pussy\" up. I reluctantly followed, and climbed into the canoe with Roy. Rick and Ken followed in the other canoe. We paddled back to the creek, and grounded our canoes before hiking to the cascades. Everyone wanted to know what happened, so I told them. They of course were laughing and poking fun at the \"old boy scout\", when we all heard the crack again. Everyone stopped talking and we listened. The noise was coming from the north of us, in the heavy brush about 15 yards away. Rod grabbed his paddle and rushed off into the woods to confront the noise maker. We heard several more cracks, and then Roy called to us to talk to him, so he could find his way out. He had run headfirst into the woods chasing whatever was making the noise, when he realized it was leading him deeper into the underbrush and away from us. It had moved westerly, and then paralleled the creek. When he called out, he was approximately 100 yards west of our position and we talked him back to us. As soon as he appeared, he ordered everyone back into the canoes and we paddled like crazy back to our island campsite. He explained that he felt whatever it was, was purposely leading him into a trap. He was certainly unnerved and because it was now late in the day, we couldn't leave. We built a very big fire that night and none of us hardly slept. About 4 am, we heard a loud splash, near our island and everyone jolted awake. We looked outside our cabin tent and didn't see anything. But we readied our clothes for an immediate pack up and head out. As soon as daylight broke, we tore down the campsite and started loading the canoes. At that point, Rick noticed a very large, wet footprint on the rocks by our canoes. It had to be at least 14 inches long and half again as wide. We looked around and there was no other traces, but we realized whatever made that footprint, also made the splashing sound and likely swam across the 100 yards of lake to pull himself out of the water. We cleared the site in no time and portaged another mile to lamb lake, and then we endured a 2 hour portage through a swamp southeast of Lamb lake before drained into Nina-Moose Lake. We spent the night on Nina-Moose, before heading out for home the next night. Neither of us smelled anything abnormal. Nor did we hear anything that resembled growling, screaming or grunting. All we heard were the sounds of tree branches being banged against other trees. Rich though he heard grunts, but it easily have resulted from our evacuation of the area and our heavy breathing.",

I have visited the BWCA and the Quetico Provincial Park (Canada's BWCA) just north of the boundary waters over 30 times since that fateful May day. I had heard tales from the Forest Rangers blaming the natives for stealing canoes from visiting campers, and taking them across the border, only to resell them. I brought this up to the tribe and everyone laughed at me. They knew the same tales and how they were blamed for the missile canoes. They asked how it would be possible to steal a canoe, unseen, or unheard and then paddle it across the lac LaCroix without getting caught in the dead of night. The trails are pitch black and very rocky. Someone would have killed themselves attempting this foolhardy adventure. They told me they too have reported missing canoes for years in the Quetico and often blamed the lazy American's for stealing their property. When I returned to Ely one year, and talking to some outfitters about this issue, nobody wanted to address the problem. Everyone wanted to blame the other guys, until one brave and forthright outfitter admitted he had a similar tale on Lady Boot lake, northwest of Lake Agnes. He had reported hearing similar sounds and grunts one night he was leading a group of Boy scouts. The kids were clearly frightened and he had never experienced anything like that night, nor wants to again.",

      "OBSERVED": "Sunday night.  I came out of the house to smoke a cigarette; it was an exceptionally cloudless, cool evening.  As I entered the yard I was immediately aware of a loud din coming from the woods about 1/3 of a mile off.  The sound of barking dogs is not unusual and is often accompanied by wolves, but this night the barking/howling sounded frantic.  Above all of this noise was a loud wailing like nothing I had ever heard before.  The source of this wailing held its position for about two minutes and then proceeded to move northeast around the lake covering a long distance in a very short time with great disturbance to the underbrush followed by a violent crushing of ice which seemed to indicate that whatever it was tried to cross a part of the frozen lake.  Each cry was quiet powerful and the duration I would estimate at about 15 seconds.  After changing positions the sound did not die out but simply stopped at the edge of the lake.  Immediately the dogs stopped barking and the wolves howling.  Dead silence.  A few minutes later the woods erupted in a cacophony of barking, howling and now birds (loons and owls)!  The wailing did not start up again but you could feel that it's presence was still there.  Afterwards, as the days went by, I tried to discredit what I'd heard but the sound was so strange and awesome that I don't think I could be convinced that what I heard was not unique.  It was not a dog, wolf, bear, coyote, deer, bird, rabbit, llama, or wild cat. I grew up at this location and lived there from 71-89, then living there on and off for the next eight years.  Eventually I moved to San Francisco, but return to that place two or three times a year.  Throughout my residence, I and others have occassionally felt a heavy omnipresent dread and foreboding, and the feeling of being watched.

When you tell people, most in not so many words call you a liar! Or I don't beleave that stuff! I'm sure a lot of you have experianced that. My first incident was a sighting, at night. My wife and kids and I were on county highway #21, headed back home to Babbitt from Virginia. On the curve just past the Wassa town hall road. The pasenger side high beam light had a broken mount. The light pointed to the oncomming traffic lane. As I was on the curve, I saw a very tall hairy creature walking accross the road. The bad headlight staid fixed on him as he crossed the road. I drive with one of my hands on top of the wheel, and this time it was my right hand. I pointed and tried to yell but nothing came out! Again I tried, still nothing! as it got into the ditch by a evergreen fall. I finnally was able to yell to my wife, \"did you see that!!\" She was playing a hand held yahtzee game. And she jumped in her seat when I yelled. I don't remember what she said, but I know she asked me what I saw. I told her I saw Bigfoot. She later told me, that she beleaved me. I can still see this in my mind clear as a bell. For a long time now I've had recurring dreams about it, some are nightmares. The second incident was again at night but only about an hour after sunset. It was durring deer season, my eldest son and I were tracking a wounded deer. It was getting dark so we decided to give up for the night. As we were leaving, One of my hunting partners showed up. He said we should give it another shot, maybe we'll get lucky. So the three of us walked together on a road that went in a big circle. We got about half way through and we split up. My son went with my partner, and I doubled back. I was about 200 yrds. from the cars, and I thought I heard a grunt. I stopped and then I heard what sounded like a  tree being broken off at the base. Then a loud grunt and a tree hitting brush and the ground toward me. I loaded the gun with the clip so fast! grabbed the fore stock with flashlight in hand and litterally walked in little circle's all 200 yrd's. to the cars. when I got there, my partner and my son arrived. I told my partner \"he's here!\". He replied I know did you find him? I said not the deer HE'S HERE!! Know way where? I said up the hill on the raod, and he through a tree at me!!!! We talked for a while and we went home. I didn't go on that road for the rest of the season. The next year, I had to know. So I went back and found the tree, the tree trunk and it had been thrown about 25 feet. It stopped up against another tree. I can show you where to this day! Last but not least.

When he was next to his car he looked to the left into a growth of pines about 50 ft away and he saw a figure there that was 6-7 ft tall and not in clothing and covered in fur head to foot. It was on two feet. He looked at it for several seconds and was too stunned himself to move and then it noticed him and ran off to a field or the woods just north of us. It ran in human form and not on 4 legs. My husband went to the area after but there was not much he could tell on the pine needles but in the grass he could see large footprints pressed down.

It looked cautious and apprehensive. It had black fur and a very hairy face more like a man than a bear (It had no snout).  It walked upright like a man.  It was not round in the body as a bear, but more lanky.  Its hard to judge the height, but it was at least as tall as a tall man.  It did not move or look like a bear.  My impression of it at that time was that it had sense of humaness about it, but it was a wild, unkempt, hairy creature.  I was quiet scared at the time and turned and got out of there in the opposite direction.  It looked like the purported Sasquatch I saw on a film strip years ago on TV, but it was not as thick as that one.  It was more lanky. I did not report this at the time to any authority, because I did not want to be labeled as a crank.  I did tell a few friends.

      "OBSERVED": "This incident occurred in early September 2012. Bear hunting season had just begun in Minnesota and I was running a few bait stations. It was maybe 07:20 in the morning when I left my house to go to my first bait station. I have never harvested a bear and this was my most promising bait station I had. It was hit every single day from the first day it was legal to bait. I had a trail camera on this bait station the week before season for a few days so I had an idea of when the bear were coming in and the general direction they were coming from. The morning was beautiful, cool and the sun was just over the horizon. This is my favorite time of day because it seems this is when the woods “come alive”. I turn off the dirt road and start down the logging trail. My bait station was located about 150 yards through the brush. The area holds a bunch of mature poplar mixed with a few maple and balsam trees. As I was sitting at the fork about to get out of the truck I was looking down the left trail, “which over time was widened out a bit by trying to avoiding the muddy areas” when I saw it. It came across the trail fast. It was about 50-60 yds from me and if I hadn’t been looking at that second I would have never saw it. Most stories about “Bigfoot” are that he is brown or black… well whatever this was was big and gray/white in color. I kind of sat there for a second, shook it off and told myself, “No, I was imagining things”. So I get out of my truck and go to grab my bait bucket when I could hear it running through the brush towards my bait station distinctively on 2 legs. I’ve bow hunted my entire life so I know the sound a 4 legged animal makes when it runs or trots.  I realized that I was not imagining things and that it really just happened. I promptly climbed back in my truck and left. Even though my goal for many years was to harvest a bear I was too shook up to return to that bait station. All bait stations are required to have your information affixed within a certain distance of the bait station. So I knew I had to return to the bait station to get my sign. A few weeks later I had a good friend of mine come out there with me. We retrieved my sign and left. This was the last time I was in that area.",

After a long day of hiking and and swimming we went back to camp, ate dinner, and that night we started the knocks. Again we hear three responses. One of the three got closer and closer after each time we responded back. My friend got creeped out and we left the woods and sat at our camp site. As we are sitting by out fire we both saw a set of eyes staring at us. Neither one of us said anything about the eyes to the other until we were on our way home. We decided to go back into the woods for one last time and as we did something very close to us made a loud grunt. I've hunted since I was 12, I have heard bears, moose and everything else that would be in the woods of Minnesota and I have no idea what this was.

      "OBSERVED": "On Saturday, October 21, 2006 my brother-in-law and I were bowhunting for deer in Alcona County in an area that we had been hunting for several years when we heard a sound that neither of us can explain. I was sitting in my tree stand facing basically south with my back to a dense cedar area with a small creek and a mixed hardwood forest in front of me.  My brother-in-law was hunting in a similar situation approximately 200 yards to my east.  The time was around 5:45 in the evening and the weather was clear and relatively warm perhaps in the upper 50s – low 60s.  At this time I had a small 4-point deer come walking down a deer run from the east toward me and stop approximately 40 yards away, standing there sniffing the air around it.  The light breeze was out of the north/northeast with the deer definitely upwind of me.  The deer stood there for about a minute or two mostly looking to the north and east, then turned directly south and walked away.  Shortly after this moment I heard a screaming sound coming from the east.  The sound had a human quality to it and sounded more angry than distressed.  I immediately thought my brother-in-law was hollering for some reason as he was in that direction but chose not to contact him via radio.  There were several short 10 second screams lasting a little over a minute and then stopped.  I sat there completely perplexed having never heard a sound like that before.  After this I noticed the conspicuous absence of any sound or movement in the forest.  Prior to this the woods had been filled with the sound of twittering birds and chattering squirrels.  After this, the forest was dead quiet.  This was the most eerie part of the whole event.  After the sun went down and I met my brother-in-law on our way back to camp he asked me what I had been doing to make that strange sound.  To him, the sound came from the west where I was sitting.  For me the sound was coming from the east where he was sitting so whatever the sound was it originated between us.  At this point neither of us had any idea of what could have made that sound.  We continued to hunt for the rest of the weekend without any more incidents or anything else unusual occurring. I had forgotten all about this when one day the following April I was watching an old episode of the television series “In Search Of” that was about the search for Bigfoot.  During this episode they talked about a particular bigfoot researcher.   For fun I went on the internet to see if this researcher was still around as this episode was 20 years old at least.  This is when I found the BFRO website and looked for sightings in Michigan.  When I found the report of the hunters being harassed in the fall of 1985 in the same area we had been in it all came rushing back to me.  Since then I found and downloaded a sound file from another website of a vocalization recording in Klamath, California.  I sent this to my brother–in-law and he agreed that this was very similar to what we had heard although what we had heard was deeper in pitch. I have thought about submitting this report a number of times since then but for whatever reason haven’t.  Now that deer season is quickly approaching I have been thinking about the incident more.  I still don’t know what it was that we heard but it certainly wasn’t anything I have ever heard before or after.  It was eerie at first returning to the location with this new found thought in my head but in the years since I have not had any additional experiences although I would like to get another chance to prove to myself that it wasn’t all a dream.",

We looked in the direction of the noise and sure enough.  There was a stick banging back and forth between two trees that were in a growth of trees.  It was a large stick and you could see the end of it very well so it had to be sticking straight out.  I'd guess it was about six and a half feet up the tree you could see it.  Just before the banging stopped there was a glimpse of something dark that couldn't be identified.  It seemed to be standing up from leaning over.  As fast as that, the noise stopped and I wasn't able to see anymore.  My friend didn't even get the glimpse from her angle.  It was clear all the way around that growth of trees so whatever it was, went straight away from us on the other side of those trees. There was no smell or fear associated with this.

It was all dark brown, about 7' tall, and running (extremely fast given the original \"startle\") silently through the ferns, branches, and sparse deadfall. It was not a bear. I was not a believer of bigfoot. I told myself it was a deer leaping (because of the silence and upright position) that covered about 11yrds. Acceptable, right?

While crossing a blown-out beaver dam, we observed 3 sets of very fresh tracks in mud.  Largest were 15-16 inches in length, while the 2 smaller sets were 8-10 inches. The mud was newly exposed, quite soft, and would have filled in quickly if tracks were more than a few hours old.  This is a very isolated area, the nearest year-round maintained road is 10 miles away, and it is a gravell road.  The tracks were very defined, and had very long strides(4+ feet for the larger tracks).  The surroundng area was a series of steep rock ridges and hills, with a small stream, heavily dammed by beavers, winding thru.  You could see where the tracks left the mud and climed the hill, and it was in an area that would be extremely difficult to walk due to steepness, and loose rock. This entire incident left my friend and I both quite shaken, and we left the area as quickly as possible.  No other sightings or incident occured, but we had noticed a distinct feeling of being observed shortly before seeing the tracks, and this had never been felt by either of us before, even though both of us have seen bear and other wildlife many times.",

      "OBSERVED": "My mom and I were driving home to Interlochen from a friend’s house. It was late afternoon / early evening. We were on Reynolds Road.  This would have been in the mid 80’s and I would have been in my mid teens. My mom was driving the car. It was quiet and we were talking. We did not have the radio on. It was a warm sunny day in either early spring or fall. As my mom was driving down the dirt road through the woods we came to a clearing on the right side. A very large, flat and empty field. No trees, just tall weeds. I remember the weeds were not green. They were a light brown. That is why I think it must have been early spring or fall. On the far side of the field I noticed an extremely large rock, more like a boulder. It must have caught my eye because it was the only thing of any height or color in the field. It was probably 3 feet tall and dark gray in color. There was nothing special about it. The only reason I even noticed it was because this large dark object stuck out in this empty colorless flat field. Suddenly several large dogs appeared on the opposite side of the road. 2 or 3 trotted right out across the road in front of us. Mom quickly stopped the car. They seemed to take no notice of us at all and continued to trot across the field on our right. They were not running, but they were moving with a purpose. 2 or 3 more dogs emerged on the left and a little more cautiously crossed the road in front of us. They did take notice of us, but as soon as they crossed the road they too began to trot across the field. Mom remained stopped and we watched the dogs. I don’t remember what they all looked like, but I do remember they were all large dogs. Maybe 75 to 85 lbs, and some of them looked like German Shepards. They were all trotting across the field and in the direction of the big rock I had noticed. Suddenly the rock stood up. It stood up slowly and gracefully. As soon as it stood up the dogs began to run towards it. Not as if to attack it, but as a dog would run toward someone he knew to greet him. My very first thought was that a man had been out with his dogs and was somehow calling them to him. I thought a “man” because it looked like a very large man in a snowmobile suit with his hood up.  A snowmobile suit because his body was not defined the way a person’s body would be. There was no separation between his shoulders and his neck – the way it looks when someone wears a jacket with a hood. It was as if my mind was trying to make sense of what I was seeing, but then I actually saw what I was looking at. It could not have been a man. It was very tall. Probably 2 feet taller than an average man. I’m guessing it must have been 8 feet. And there was no reason for a man to be wearing a snowmobile suit. They day was much too warm. He was all dark gray in color with no body definition. It was just all gray and big and bulky. His arms were also longer then a man’s. His hands hung down by his knees. By this time the dogs were all with him and excitedly running around and jumping. I remember thinking that the dogs were obviously “with” him. I also remember thinking that he must have called or whistled to the dogs. I don’t actually remember having my window down, but I must have because I remember thinking that if he had called or whistled I would have heard it. He then began to walk into the woods. He moved oddly. Not the way a man would walk. He had very large strides and his legs were bent like someone running but he was walking. It was similar to watching someone run in slow motion. And his arms swung back and forth in exaggerated motions. He moved into the woods very quickly but he was just seemed to calmly walk away. He had been right on the edge of the woods so we were not able to watch for very long before he and all the dogs disappeared into the trees. I remember just staring at the spot in the woods while my mom began to drive away. I felt like I was in shock like I had just seen something that I could not have possibly seen. I just sat quietly and looked out the window. I looked at my mom a couple times and she was just staring straight ahead as she drove. We never said a word to each other. Once we got home we walked into the kitchen, looked at each other and just started crying. We didn’t talk about what we had just seen. The only thing either of us kept saying was that we could never tell anyone what we had just seen. Since then we have told a few people but I honestly don’t think they believe us. It took years before either of us told anyone. I feel like they believe we saw “something”, but maybe it was explainable and we have exaggerated the story or something. Mom and I actually went back to find the location for the first time this past summer.  We began driving down the dirt road and even after more than 20 years we had no trouble finding the location. We rounded a curve and there was the field on our right. And even though over 20 years have passed we both rolled our windows up and locked our doors.",

It was probably around two or three A.M. when we finally hit County Line Rd. outside of where my mother lives. We were both staying with her at the time of the sighting. My mother lives in Buckley, about six miles down County Line Rd, once you turn off the main highway (can't recall the name of the highway at the moment.) We were about a half a mile or so down County Line Rd when we were talking, making jokes. We were both very tired. I turned to say something to her and when we both looked back strait ahead on the road ahead, I saw a tall \"thing\" literally take two steps and it was accross the road. It stood aprox. seven or eight feet tall. (my husband at the time was six five so it was easier to make out the difference) as soon as we saw it, we both jumped and said \"did you just see that!?\" We emediaitely knew what we both saw and I raced back to my mom's house. once we were back home, we recalled the details. We were finnishing each other's sentances which was very disturbing KNOWING we recollected the same thing. It still seems funny to think about but the \"thing\" had long flowing fur. It actually looked GROOMED! The hair was all over it's body and it was brownish with silverish tips. The arms were very long hung down just above it's knees. The head was hunched down and we did not see the face. We laugh about it now and still get chills especially when we both recall how the thing was walking like it had someplace to be. It was the strangest thing. We both agreed that it was walking in haste not as if it were trying to get away from something or someplace, rather, almost like a person would walk hastily on a city street when they are late for a job or an appointment or something like that.",

My husband and I went for a visit to my mother's home and my mother told me the man down the road was just beginning to head down County Line Rd. going back toward the way we were coming when we had our sighting. The story was, he was just starting to pick up speed and he was alone in his truck during the day when he had to slow down because he noticed \"something crouthced down in the road\".  He had to eventually come to a complete stop when the animal turned to look at him and proceeded to run off down the ditch and into the woods. The description of it was that it had hair all over it's body, it had a puggish nose and the chest was more bare. They said he was saying it probably stood about seven feet tall........\tI would like to know if there are other people in this are who have had similar sightings. We have had a lot of strange happenings in this area even other than just these sorts of sightings. Is that usual?  I know of other's in the surrounding area....... Kinglsey, Fife Lake, Boardman Valley, etc.. who have seen strange unexplainable things but most of the people I know of aren't the types that might report what they are seeing. meaning quiet, nice people that don't want to stir things up in any way. I once asked a gas station attendant in the Kingsley area about it not long after the sighting and he laughed and said \"that's nothing new\"..........Please let me know if there are more people in this area who have had simmilar experiences.

When I laid the paddle against the side of the canoe I startled approximately six whitetails which promptly blew at me and took off.  The next thing I did was set up a fishing pole supported by a small stick and then set up camp.  Next, thinking the pole hit the ground I walked over wih my mini-maglight and noticed that the pole had not fallen as ti had sounded like.  I heard some leaves/sticks crack up the big bank (approx. 20 feet above my head), shined there and saw two big eyes staring back at me.  The color was beautiful pale yellow and clear as glass.  I noticed the animal move its neck slightly one way then the next to see me better.  It had to be a timber wolf.  There were no others with it.  We stood there looking at each other for quite some time. The wolf wouldn't budge so I shined the light on my face, snarled at it and kind of hollered and off  went Canis lupus to the other side of the Marquette State Forest.  Then I proceeded to set up camp, build the fire and lay down being  tired and hungry and hopefully wait for a fish to hit the spawn.  About 10 minutes after seeing the wolf, something big (by the size of the scream) came to the edge of the bank 20 or so feet above and screamed at me twice.  I grabbed the 38, cocked the hammer back and laid the pistol on my stomach.  There was one more scream after about 20 seconds and then silence and beautiful stars overhead.  I didn't look for tracks the next day because of sleeping late the next morning and wondering how many more days it would take me to get back to the next bridge 0n SR115.",

My friend and I were bored so we decided to go walking around in the woods adjacent to my home which was a one room school house my step dad was remodeling. We did these walks often, looking for cool places to build forts or just exploring. This time we went further back through an old apple orchard and thats when it happened.  As we were walking we both noticed it was really quiet.  No sounds of birds or animals. Nothing at all. We were a little amazed at the silence. Then the wind picked up a little, which blew the leaves around. There were still a lot on the trees. The leaves blowing broke the silence, so we started to move on. I had this weird feeling of being watched. I told my friend. He said he had it too. At that moment we both heard this loud thumping crunch. I said, \"Did you here that!?\" He nodded yes, afraid to talk because it was loud and close, robably 50ft away. It was like something had stomped the ground. I said it sounded like it came from over there, turning to the direction of the noise, we both saw this big upright animal covered in hair. It immediately moved into the deep brush and trees while making this deep kind of throated noise like \"Ugh!\" All we could see was the back 3/4 the way up the stomach, the butt and the left leg going into the brush. It wasn't crouching. It was upright, like it was just walking by. I started running, not thinking of my friend. I ran as fast as I could to my house which was about a  350 ft away, through dense brush, partial swamp and a trail. When I stopped my friend was right there, which surprised me, because I thought I could run faster than him. This thing's leg was at least as tall as me.  I was about 5'4 at 14 years old. It was dark reddish with some grey in it about 3-4 inches long. The fur was super thick. It's leg was thicker than my body. Out of the blue my friend recently visited me. We haven't seen each other since high school and we're both in our forties now. The second thing he asked was do ya remember what we saw behind your house.  I told him yeah we saw a dam bigfoot, and I don't think I have ever run so fast or strong since, not even when I was in the marines. Since then I have been always watchful for these critters.",

As a rural resident and outdoorsman I was not shocked by them at all. This area has wolverine and cougar in it that once were deemed extinct from Mn. Did not get out to investigate as I was lightly armed and in awe of their size. Would compare to Clydesdale horses in height. Would presume the creatures were in annual migration from wisconsin just like the bears.You will find reports on them to be more active moving east to west from mid August to October. Bears den on the cold [north] side of a slope. So this bigfoot likely uses the south side. Once had hell scared out of my dog by a small black creature that appeared to be sitting on ground with legs crossed eating. This was so near dark and before I saw the big ones that I assumed that the shadows in the forest \"created \" the little guy. Now I'm not so sure. Anyway!!!! If you want to photo bigfoot I suggest the area around the St. Croix river at dusk in early autumn. The French explorer traders called this area passe a'lours - passage of the bears.

On my left I saw a \"man\" hunch his shoulders, duck his head and turn away from me.  As I looked right I realized I had seen the figure of a man on my left.  When I turned back I saw the back of a dark head and shoulders disappear into the hazelnut brush.  I then realized that any man out in the woods on opening day of deer season would have been wearing an orange hat and coat, while this one was clad in dark brown/black.  I was certain what I had seen was a bigfoot.  I thought about looking for tracks, then remembered my gun had just let me down while trying to shoot a deer, so I made tracks in the opposite direction of this creature.

We were near an area where there were alot of berries and were making sure that we didn't stumble upon a bear (which we had done many timees, and let me tell you...this was no bear).  We heard a howling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up...literally.  ee both hit the deck and reloaded our 12g shotguns with slugs.  Not a word was exchanged.  We were both rather scared.  It was nearing Nightfall, and we had a long way to go to get back to the car.  This is a very rugged and remote area.  The howling was intermittent, but we could hear the animal moving.  It was a couple hundred yards away.  Unfortunately for us it was directly in our path.  This is a swampy lake filled area with heavy growth.  I have travelled all over the world, and this is some of the toughest undergrowth that I have ever seen. We cautiously moved toward the trail (and the animal) and moved a quietly as we could.  We were both experienced woodsman, and we knew this was no Timberwolf, Moose, Bear or cat. We dropped the 3 grouse we had shot as a precaution and contiued along the trail.  Off to our right we heard movement.  I remember being terrified.  It was clear that it was a large creature, but it moved VERY fast.  Faster than any Bull moose I had ever encountered. It followed us on our right flank for a few hundred yards.  It was now approaching dark.  We had lights with us, as well as first aid kits. I turned to my friend and pointed.  At that moment we could see a complete outline of this creature.  The reason it was visible, was that we were in the growth, and it was following, but there was a clearing beind it (an old logging camp area) and the light was still brigh behind it.  We both hit the deck again.  I find it funny that the thought of shooting at it didn't even cross our minds.  We were scared.  I had worked as a wilderness guide, and this was nothing that I had ever seen before.  It walked on 2 feet and stood AT LEAST 7 feet tall.  There was no way to really tell the color (due to the lighting adn our perspective) but it was a dark color.  We continued on our way all the while listening to this thing in the brush following us.  It was amazingly stealthy.  Like I said we were VERY experienced woodsman for our age.  We didn't do drugs or drink like other kids our age...we went hunting and fishing. It finally stopped following us as we crossed a ridge toward a more travelled trail.  We both remember the day like it was yesterday.  We recently spoke of it.

      "OBSERVED": "It was late October 1975.  I was coon hunting on a beautiful, still, and moonlit night.  I was walking along a picked corn strip at the wood line, along the top of a ridge.  My two coon dogs were hunting out ahead.  I heard my old dog bark a few times, then come running by me with her tail tucked under.  The other dog was young, but not afraid of anything.  Where the old dog came out of the woods, he went in.  With a loud, savage bark and growl, he came out also and stayed by me, leaning against my leg growling and quivering.  It was then that I heard a very low, moaning-type sound which was very audible.  I shined my light down into the woods, but could not see anything as the land dropped off rather steeply into a large wooded ditch, maybe 200 feet deep.  It was then that I heard what is best described as a large rock being thrown and bounced into a brush pile.  I hollered, \"whose there\"!  Then it sounded like someone hitting a hardwood tree with a club, twice.  I then backed up myself, with my dog still looking down hill growling and never leaving my side.  I could hear whatever it was moving down the steep hillside in the leaves and up the other side.  That definitely ended my hunt as the dogs would not hunt there anymore. About two weeks later, after our deer season hunt was over, I saw a friend of mine and asked how his deer hunting went.  He hunted on the very same land I was on.  Usually his party killed many deer.  However, he said something was really strange as they never saw any deer at all.  Also, the property owner's cattle would not leave the farm buildings. I have always remembered this experience.  While watching television at a friend's house, I watched your show.  When you mentioned the \"hitting tree sounds\" it rang a bell in \"this old man's head.\"  Could it have been a Big Foot or not?  I don't know, but I just had to write about my mystery.",

While we were taking turns riding our motorcycle, my eleven year old son spotted what looked like a \"cave man\" sitting near our camp site, about 75 yeards away. The view of it was slightly obstructed by some large straw bales, therefore I didn't see it at first when my son tried to point it out to me. By the time I finally saw it, it had stood up and was walking away towards heavy tree growth and a steep ravine. What I saw was a very large, man-like, reddish brown colored, hairy creature with its back towards me. All I could see was it's upper half, stooped forward slightly, with what appeared to be a very long, muscular right arm. The Head appeared larger than human from my angle. My son saw the right side of it's face, saying it looked like a cave-man like in the books. The face had light brown skin, with no hair on it's face, but slightly deformed-looking. That's about all he can recall. I think it took him totally by surprise. It appeared to be about seven feet tall. After calming down from this we decided to walk in the direction it headed for and found three or four very large foot prints in the creek bed area. They were slightly larger than my size thirteen boots, with five distinct human-type toes. Later that afternoon while I was riding the dirt bike, it suddenly stopped on me, about a half mile from the sighting. Looking at the wiring on the motorcycle, and alone there in the gully, I heard a very high pitched scream coming from what seemed a quarter to half mile away from me, opposite the direction of our camp. i thought it might be my family, but after getting the bike up and running right away, I quickly discovered it couldn't have been them. They were near our camp to the rear of me. No one else was on the land but us. That evening, our closest neighbor's ( 1 1/2 miles away) dog started barking like crazy around 11:00 pm and was heading our way down thru the woods. I could hear the dog barking all night long, while  what seemed he was following or chasing something all over the place. Around 3:30 am, I could hear the dog was about one hundred yards away from us, just going nuts and acting very vicious. All of a sudden, while laying there in our tent, I heard something huge come crashing thru the trees and run right by my head, with what sounded like bi-pedal type footsteps, only extremely fast and heavy (the ground near my head shook somewhat when it went by), with the dog right behind it. I sat up and counted the heads in my tent to be sure we were all accounted for. Then the dog let out a terrible yelp and everything got very quiet. Needless to say, I stayed up and slowly went outside to check on things and light a camp fire for warmth and security.",

      "OBSERVED": "This happened a long time ago, I just found your website and I thought I might as well talk about our incident.  Those of us involved do not talk about it much, I probably the most.  There was 6 of us and we were camping on the Otter Creek south of the airport in Cloquet, MN, Carlton County.  It had to have been in 1977. I was 16 and the others were 15-16 years old.  This was my fishing and camping site on the pipeline and I had built a lean too and we were all out there that Friday evening drinking some beer and going to fish for trout in the morning.  We had a camp site with a fire pit and we had a good bon fire going.  We were sitting around the campfire it must have been around 9-10 P.M. We were not drunk out of our minds.  In the distance we heard this walking coming from the east in the woods following the creek.  I had been chased by a bear out there on occasion so I felt it was a bear coming down the creek.  Then it sounded like a person walking through the woods so we thought it may be the Game Warden, who knew all of us kids and he may be checking for trout lines.  Then came the odor, Worst case of B.O. I have ever smelled to be honest. I again thought this is a bear because of the smell and I started to get a little nervous because we had food out there but it was hung up in a tree. As it approached us, it came far enough into the light to show a shadow.  It was on 2 legs standing up, very tall, every bit of I would say 8 foot, and walking in very huge strides, swinging it arms, making alot of noise.  It stayed enough away from us and circled to our south and stayed close enough to see the shadow. Once it circled us it was back on it's line heading west as it had been the whole time we had heard it coming, following the creek bed.  We were all so scared as to who or what it was we sat in silence around the fire as it passed, watching, and not sure of what we were watching. Again I can tell you the smell was obnoxious.  To be honest, I have smelled bears before and since, and they really do not have that kind of obnoxious odor. As I said before, I am the only one that really talks about it, seeing your web site I see back in that time period there were several sightings in St. Louis County which is a county bordering Carlton County.  I had no idea there had been sightings in this area before.  I can not say for sure what it was because all I seen was a shadow. But a srange type of shadowed figure to see in the woods. A bear could not walk that long on 2 legs, plus a bear does not take the strides that this creature did.  The only thing I can come up with is that we had an experience with a Big Foot.  We never did go and look for foot prints the next morning.  I think we were all glad it did not come into our camp because we had no clue as to what it was.  I have no reason to tell a story about this and I am not known by people as a story teller.  Seeing your web site, I felt it belongs here.",

      "OBSERVED": "Doubt this rises to a level of super credible sighting, but thought I'd pass it along anyway. I work at a golf course in northern MN which abuts a large state park. The other early morning \"something\" was walking in the woods just off a paved cart path but went out of view behind a small building used as bathrooms. What made this odd was: Size: Very tall and lanky Gait: The gate was very long and easy in heavy brush Speed: Not running but covered ground quickly Location: I find it hard to believe that a human would walk through dense brush ten feet in and parallel to a paved trail. Plus, no houses are near. Color: Uniformly tan/red from head to toe. Disappearance: After walking behind the building, the creature did not exit the other side meaning it made a complete 90 degree left turn to walk away from me with the small building blocking my view or it just disappeared. Other sightings: There have been other sightings in recent years within a 30 mile radius. Also, I live one mile from this site and had an odd experience several years ago. I'd left the sprinkler on in the garden in the summer and went outside after dark to turn the faucet off alongside the house. As I walked towards the spigot, I heard a loud low growl from the corner of my house and about ten feet from my spigot. Too low and guttural for a dog or wolf and I've never heard bears growl before although I have confronted them and they just kind of snarl or snap their jaws. This was different. What was very odd is that after hearing the growl you'd think my reaction would be to turn and run or freeze as I was about ten feet from the source, but I said loudly in my head \"stop growling, I'm just gonna turn the water off.\" I then felt at ease and not scared at all. Nothing. Sorta numb. I then walked towards the growl, turned off the spigot, turned around with my back to the growl, and slowly walked back in the house. I then sat back in my living room and only later my mind cleared and I thought \"what the heck? My daughter used to complain about someone looking in her window on that side of the house too, but I chalked it up to \"boogiemen.\"",

But, here goes, just the same; Around the first week in October of this year, I had decided to go out squirrel hunting since it was such a nice day. I went out to a piece of land we had previously owned and have retained hunting rights on it. I had just left my truck and headed down into the woods, checking out a large rock/over-hang formation when something moving to my right (southwest) about 175-200 feet away, caught my eye. I was looking thru rather thick brush, separated by a barbed wire fence, a  creek bed and lots of vegetation and thick brush. At first, all I could see was what looked like \"the biggest turkey I'd ever seen' flapping its wings in a very strange way. All I could make out was something that appeared to be a very large black turkey flapping its wings in a very strange, but fast manner. I moved around to the right a little bit to try and get a better look, when all of a sudden this thing gets up on two feet and starts running like a bat out of hell. It no more got up when suddenly another one, much larger and reddish brown in color jumped up behind it and in its attempt to catch up to the black one, appeared to almost fall forward, all the while moving very, very fast and disappearing just as quickly, but amazingly quietly thru some of the thickest brush we have down there. I think I was frozen stiff in disbelief, trying to gather what I had just seen. I stood there, dazed for about a minute and decided to cross the barbed wire fence and creek bed and go over to where I had seen \"them\" get up and run. Once I got over there, I found indentations in the soft grassy, almost marsh-like terrain, but no real discernable tracks. what is interesting is that what I thought I had seen as a turkey flapping it's wings,was probably the black animal sitting or kneeling, and reaching up for choke-cherries on the tree it was nearby. I followed their brief trail right up to where they silently entered the thick brush and decided not to go any further, thinking that if two creatures so huge could go thru that thick brush so quitely, how would I ever know they hadn't circled back and were watching me from behind? I got spooked at that thought and got out of there. I told my wife what I saw and the friend of our's we had sold the land to.",

      "OBSERVED": "My mother told me this story a few years ago.  The incident happened when she was a young  in the woods surrounding her child hood home. She said she was picking blue berries one day. It was near dark and she was by herself. She wasn't far from home but she was on the edge of a very large forest and swamp. She said she got a funny feeling, like someone was watching her. She looked up from her blue berry pail and noticed someone crouched in the blue berry patch a little ways away staring directly at her. Then it ducked quietly below a  line of brush and berries At first she tought it was one of her brothers or possibly her father who had come to bring home.  She took a few steps toward the place where she had last noticed the person.  At that point the \"whatever-it-was\" bolted unseen into some nearby brush. She saw alot of brush move when it bolted and she was sure at that point it wasn't a person. It simply moved to mush brush to be a person. Thinking it was a bear enjoying the same blueberries as her, she began walking quickly toward home.  A few steps from the blue berry patch she turned to look over her shoulder.  She then noticed (I will describe it in her words) \"something really, really tall standing by a tree.  It looked like a huge man all covered with hair. When I saw it, it ducked behind the tree. I was so scared I started running for home as fast as my little legs would go. \"I looked back when I got near the edge of the woods. I saw it comming after me, but it was like it was keeping its distance and it was bent over. Its arms were huge and at its sides. \"I screamed because it was chasing me and saw it jump off the trail behind a tree. It almost hit its head on some low limbs but it put its arm up to move the branches away.  It made alot of noise when it crashed into the brush. I kept screaming because I knew it was following me and I ran to the house and told my brothers.\" Evidently her brothers went armed to the site and found an area of brush that had be matted down. They tought a bear must have been there because the whole area smelled bad. My mother never mentioned a bad smell. Just the funny feeling that someone was watching her. She said that not much was mentioned after that evening about it and she only remembered it because it scared her so bad. She also said none of her family teased her about it and her brothers wouldn't talk about it. (Did they find something in the woods or have they had similar experiences?)",

      "OTHER_STORIES": "Some of the people in that area used to talk about the \"Swamp Lady\". As the story goes, a young  13 or 14 yrs old got lost in the woods and was never found. They say she must have survived deep in the swamp. Her hair grew very long and she was a very big woman. Hunters say they have seen or heard her over the years. They figure that she must have become scared of people after many years without human contact. My mother said people would hear her screaming in the woods or swamps from time to time. But it was at night and no one wanted to go looking. The problem I have with that story is I have been in those woods. I find it impossible to believe that anyone could survive a winter out there without some serious  gear and knowledge. The temp. plumates to 60 degrees below zero and blizards can effectively shut down entire towns for days. I don't doubt that a  may have been lost in the woods or swamp and may have lived till fall but not through the winter.  They get  winters in that part of the country and I have seen damage to animal populations because of them. I believe the locals were telling the truth about the young  being lost. But I think what they saw and heard in later years was something much different. I also believe my relatives, who still live in the area, have had other experiences similar to this but are unwilling to talk about them.",

We would split up for the morning and then return around noon to a place we called the kitchen to build a fire and have lunch. That day I just kept going south and west because the swamps where frozen and I was seeing plenty of deer sign. It was getting close to noon so I decided to cut north east with my compass and hopefully pick up our trail and meet back at the kitchen for lunch. I came to a swamp with lot's of alder brush and tamarack but I could see highland about a quarter mile through it so I decided to go to it not knowing exactly where I was. The first thing I noticed that was strange was the deer sign had just stopped not a track around. I finally reached the highland and to my surprise through the middle it looked like a trail with branches broken of high. I saw what at first I thought where pac boot tracks then I looked at them closer it looked like a human foot print with toes. It was 12- 14 inches long with a heal that was 4 inches wide and maybe 5 inches across the toes. It was a very creepy feeling and I was glad to have my deer rifle. I wasn't sure what to do but decided to follow them for awhile since they where going the direction I needed to go. When I got to the swamp it looked like it took of running north so I just kept going north east. I finally made it back to the kitchen and met up with the other hunters. I was reluctant to say anything but decided that I had to. Of course they all looked at me like I was crazy. Then I told them that with the snow I could track myself and find my way back there so someone had to come with me to see what I saw. My high school buddy said he would. We started out and I new that daylight time was short but we did make it  back to that highland and my buddy saw the tracks and to this day we still can only say that they where bigfoot tracks. The next day I wanted to bring a couple of other people to the site but the weather turned warm and the snow had melted enough that I couldn't find the location. Everyone was tired trying to find it so we never did get back there. That was 20 years ago and I still tell the story once in a while but have never written it down. Finding this site has made me feel better about what we saw that day and instead of trying to just let it rest it has made me think more strongly about it again. When I read the eye witness account from the young kid seeing a bigfoot over by Cotton, MN, that was  close to the same time period and the distance is only 30 some miles maybe it was the same one.

      "OBSERVED": "I need to speak to someone personally about my incident right away. I was walking alone through the Lost Forty scientific natural area near Dora Lake MN on this past Wednesday the 3rd of June 2015. Around 12 o'clock noon. Just last week as I was taking pictures of the 350 year old white pines with my camera phone. My Dad was back in the car and he honked the horn and yelled at me to come back as he was getting impatient as always. I immediately heard strange unexplainable sounds after he honked the horn. I believe he startled whatever it was back there because the sounds were getting louder after he honked the horn. I was deep in the forest and you could hear a pin drop. The sounds I heard were absolutely unexplainable for me to write down. It sounded like there must be a 500 pound woodpecker back here banging into some trees. I didn't think anything of it because nothing really scares me. I carried on, taking many beautiful pictures of the untouched white pines deep into the Lost Forty scientific and natural area. 15 minutes after my hike,I heard a tree starting to loudly crack and fall within 20 maybe 30 feet from where I was standing still. Startled, I looked all around 360 degrees to make sure it didn't fall on top of me. Just less than 20 to 30 feet away this GIANT birch tree flung back up into the air in its original upright position. The path was curved so I couldn't see around the next corner on the ground. I had less than 5 seconds as my mind was running through all the possibilities of what just happened. I have never been so afraid in my entire life and nothing ever really scares me. I thought it may be a bear at first but that tree was so big I almost ruled it out right away. I immediately ran for my life in the opposite direction as fast as humanly possible about a quarter mile back to the car. I was afraid whatever it was had been chasing me. It wasn't thank God, because halfway to the car I had to stop and catch my breath for about a minute. It seemed like I ran forever and I thought this was the end of me. As I was running back to the car my Dad heard me running through the forest huffing and puffing, and he thought I was just messing with him. He told me that \"I looked like I had just seen a ghost and, what the hell just happened?\". I drove away from that place going about 80 miles an hour. Couldn't barely breath for a half hour. I have never heard or seen or experienced anything like this in my whole life. I did not personally see it, but it saw me and must have climbed up a large birch tree causing it to bend down and crack as the creature fell to the ground. As I described the event to other people and some locals throughout the week, some said it was not a bear. They told me to watch your show on tv. I am watching your TV show for the first time now while I'm typing this. I have never seen your show before today. And as I see those people in your Base camp episode. I'm realizing I was only a half hour drive away from most of those incidents. We have a summer home in Blackduck MN. I was up there for my annual fishing trip, I live in Rockford IL. So I am very far away from where it happened right now. If you are looking for a sasquatch I suggest you head to the Lost Forty scientific natural area (SNA) in Northern Minnesota. I'm never going back there alone. Maybe for the right reasons if there were people with firearms with me. And I hope you guys please contact me by phone right away.This was only a few days ago so every detail is fresh in my mind still.",

      "OBSERVED": "My son and I were hauling our gear down to the canoe after spending the night camping. We passed each other at the top of the hill and a few seconds later I heard through the woods, maybe 125 yards away, an extremely loud bellowing, kind of like a wounded grizzly, but really really loud, it lasted 10-15 seconds then there was a pretty loud muffled talking for maybe 20-30 seconds more. What I mean by loud muffled talking is it sounded like talking that was loud, but I couldn't understand what was being said, like a different language or something? I continued down to the canoe and headed back to the campgrounds and my son was coming back down and I said \"what in the heck was that?\". He said  \" I don't know, but it was loud\". It was a dead, calm day, about 3:30 in the afternoon. The sound came from a point on the river, I told my son to go down to the canoe and watch upstream towards the rapids that go around the point and I went and got the shotgun.  I went down to the point a way that I could move quiet, so I was slowly going down there and I was hedging to the left side of the point. I hadn't heard anything, I could start to see the pool of the river upstream from the rapids so I eased over to look in the pool for fish rising, when not very far ahead of me something starts moving through the brush. It is real thick in there, I couldn't see anything, it made a real heavy sound when it stepped, I could hear every step it took, thump, thump, thump, thump, I eased to my right as to make sure it couldn't circle around me, as the point isn't very wide and my son could see the downstream side as well. The thumping and moving through the brush went towards the rapids then they quit, I headed that way to see if I could get a glimpse of what it was, but I walked right to where the point hits the rapids, and saw nothing, there are exposed rocks in the water, there was no splashing on any of them, whatever crossed had to leap rock to rock to cross, the first one being about 8 feet from shore,it may be 30 yards wide there. The point is not very big, whatever was there walked very hard on the ground and could not have gone any place else but where I followed it, by sound, like I said it was a dead quiet day, all I could hear was it footsteps and brush moving and water faintly gurgling at the rapids. No animal I know of leaps rock to rock when pursued, they just splash across to get away. We set up a trail camera there for a month and did not get any pictures.",

When I first saw it I was going down a slight dip in the road.  It appeared that the figure was facing me, but as I approached descending into the dip in the road I could only see the upper body, it was turning and appeared to quickly retreat to the side of the road.  I lost sight because of the dip in the road but when I came up on the other side within about 2 seconds there was no trace of the figure.  The trees are trimmed back about 50 ft so I was surprised that I couldn't see what at the time I thought was a person.  When I got to the area where I thought the figure had entered the woods I slowed to look for it.  I saw nothing.  The woods are pine woods where you can see back under the branches clearly for over 100 ft.  The ground surface was icy with a very sparse snow falling.  I saw no tracks but that could be because of the ice.

      "OBSERVED": "I was driving on my way to school at 6:30am.  I'd just left my house and was only about 2 miles from home.  To my right was a large pig farm, and about a quarter mile ahead and on my left, was just a small farm.  I wasn't even driving the speed limit because the road was very icy.  I'd just come up to the driveway of the pig farm when I saw in my headlights what I initially thought to be a snowmobile pulling up out of the ditch right next to the mailbox.  It stopped and appeared that what I thought to be the operator of the snowmobile was standing and leaning down to reach the handlebars.  I instantly thought it was strange that they didn't have their headlights on.  At that moment, the figure bolted across the road.  The way I can describe it best is that it ran the way a young child would racing against friends.  The differences were, that the size made me believe that there was no way it was a child, it ran so fast and disappeared into the woods behind the house of the small farm and the amount of steps it took were so few that it couldn't have been any person that I knew.  I called my husband right away and asked about the owner of the home and if they were strange or different and if he would have any explanation as to why they would be out so early in the morning checking their mailbox.  I was trying to rationalize the situation.  He said that the owner of the property was \"normal\" as far as he  knew, but they had moved out months ago and nobody had been there since.  I wasn't able to make out too much detail as the sun hadn't quite come up over the horizon, but I could tell that it was tall and bulky with long arms and a very long stride.  This would explain why I thought the shadowed outline was a snowmobiler standing up and holding onto the handlebars.  An average person would appear taller, would look large in width because they most likely would have plenty of warm clothing and a helmet on and would appear to have longer arms down by their knees if they were reaching for the handlebars.  This residence is about 3 miles from the Roseau River and just a couple more miles from the wildlife refuge.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was nearly 13 years old at the time. We lived in a trailer park away from town, but I can't remember what road it was on. One evening I was home alone. My mother had gone to pick up my stepfather. It was around 8-9 pm. I was sitting in the living room watching TV when my dog starting acting strange. He stood up with his hackles raised and started to growl, staring at the back door of the trailer. The back door of the trailer was in the hallway just off the living room. We had an outside light on the telephone pole in the backyard which was shining into the privacy window of the back door. His behavior caught my attention because he was a gentle natured dog who loved people. This was the first and only time I ever heard him growl like that. As I looked up to see what was bothering him, I noticed a shadow filling the entire window of the back door. My dog lifted his nose to sniff in the direction of the door, and suddenly his posture changed in an instant. He started cowering, tucked his tail between his legs, and quickly came over to hide by me. I had never seen him act this way before. Then the shadow went by the living room window, and it nearly filled the entire window. The shadow stayed in place for a few seconds, then moved away from the trailer. I could smell a faint skunk-like odor as well. I didn't have the courage to open the door and look outside for the source of the shadow. I wasn't even about to walk down the hall to my bedroom until my mother got home. (My dog didn't want to walk down the hall either.) We were both petrified! We stayed on the couch until my mother and stepfather came home about 30-45 minutes later. I'm sure they were puzzled as to why I was huddled on the couch with my dog, instead of in bed. I was afraid to tell them about the incident. Now I wish I would have at least told my mother. I've always wondered what could have been large enough to fill the whole window like that.",

But though I have forgotten many things from my 20's the pictures in my mind .. even the sounds of breaking twigs .. everything from that night is still crystal clear. I have not questioned what we saw ever and still hold true to the fact that what we saw was nothing other than what is called \" big foot \". It was August I believe 1994, Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area outside of Branson Mo. 1:00 A.M. A friend of mine and I had just got off work and pulled over at what was then the scenic overlook. A trail at that time wound back and forth in appropriately 60 foot lengths as it progressed up the hill to an old fire tower. If i was there I could show you exactly where we were and where \" it \" was but i will do my best to describe. We had gone up the path two turns when we heard a loud snapping sound in the quiet night. we both instantly froze and looked up. Between the 3rd and fourth path turn we could see it. a huge large slightly slumped big foot. Long arms ... sillouetted almost by the city lights and open area behind it .. we just stood there. Shocked... the friend I was with after what seemed like 5 minutes of frozen still .. yelled HEY .. and then one foot from it ... a second slightly shorter one stood up and turned to look right at us then they both ran off. The running was so significant because they ran on back legs but hunched over with long arms and it was loud. Snapping twigs and pushing their bodies right through small trees in the way. We waited a moment and then walked the trail to where they had been standing. Using a close by tree to estimate the height of the tallest. it had to be at least 7.5 feet tall if it wasn't slumped. We heard another snap in the woods and ran full sprint to the fire tower at the top of the hill and stayed there the entire night. We didn't talk much about it ... still in shock I think ..

      "OBSERVED": "I was hunting with a friend and we had been out since early morning, it was hot and we were tired. We were just trying to get back to the car, which was parked, on a dirt road about a mile up a ridge that was directly in front of us. The brush we were walking through was thick, really difficult to get through. We were walking single file and I was behind my friend with my head down concentrating on just trying to get through the brush with out tripping. Suddenly I heard an incredibly loud disturbance to my left and at the same time my friend had froze in his tracks. As I looked to my left, this animal, there is no doubt a Bigfoot, came tearing down the ridge right in front of us. It could not have been 10-15 feet from us. It was so close, it must have been sleeping and we woke it, because something that big would have made a lot of noise crashing through the brush on approach, and I heard nothing until it was right on us. We both watched it run past us to our right, on down this ridge and disappear into the forest. It was huge, covered with black fur and long, long arms. As it went by us it turned its face toward us and its face was flat and hairless, but almost black, like its face had been caked with mud all its life. It was bent forward slightly, running and it was still 7-8 feet tall. I was shocked at the speed. This encounter took no longer than 10 seconds. We both stood there scared to death, really scared. We both were familiar with the concept of Bigfoot, and had heard the stories of \"monsters in the woods\". After we both got under control, I said, \"what was that\" and my friend said \"I don’t know but I'm getting out of here\". We both started to run as best we could for the fence line and the road about a mile in front of us. When we reached the road, we were climbing a fence that lined the road, as were crossing this fence we heard the most bone chilling scream I have ever heard in my life. This just added to our terror and we continued to run for the car. We did make it out of there with nothing else to report. I had returned to that same area many times after, always with the same friend and never saw or heard another thing. That was 31 years ago and I can still remember it like it was this morning.",

Not knowing what it was I grabbed a handful of chat from the ground and threw it in the direction of the steps. The creature took a number of steps back into the woods. Then it stopped and started coming back towards us. It was a two legged creature. You could tell it was walking on two legs. At that point we both got up and ran to the car. We then drove back and forth returning to gather what we could off of the ground and we left the area. At this point we drove back to the highway and to a roadside park where we spent the rest of the night in the car. The next morning we went back, restarted our fire from the night before, I prepared breakfast, eggs and bacon. After cleaning up the dishes we began walking the trail [ Mark Twain National Forest ]. Approximately 1 mile in we stopped at a spring I knew about to get a drink and fill our canteens and continue down the trail which followed a creek. After walking another mile or so I heard a noise coming from our right, I looked to my right and then I saw it. Up the wooded hill I saw a reddish long haired man type of creature, approximately 7-8 foot tall running through the woods. I was able to see it for around 5 steps before it cleared the top of the hill and disappeared. At this point I turned to the girl I was with and asked her if she saw it. She said no but at this point I was ready to go and she didn't argue with me and we walked back down the trail to her car and we left. I got no argument from her.

Instead of going down into our usual campsite area, my parents decided to sleep off the night in our station wagon at the top of the ridge by the abandoned cabins. During the night, (I don't remember the time, as I was pretty young at the time) I remember hearing some breaking sounds in the wooded area around us. I then heard mom and dad talking by the campfire. I guess I rose up from my spot in the back of the station wagon and mom asked me if I heard \"it\". I told her that I heard what I thought to be branches breaking, she and my dad said that they have heard it several times within the last few minutes. At any rate, I went back to sleep and woke up early in the morning, at which time we drove on down to our usual campsite. While my mother was cooking breakfast on our portable camp stove, my dad was collecting wood for a camfire. My sisters and I were in the area where my mother was, as we had erected a tent and there was still things to be laid out, unpacked, etc. A few minutes later, my father shouted for my mother to come to his location. As kid's usually do, we followed my mother and went to see what dad was wanting. Upon arrival at his location, which was a dried up creek bed, he pointed to a very large footprint in the creek bed. I'm sure that there might have been other prints, but I can only remember seeing one, and it was huge. We did not have anything to preserve that print with us and dad said something about going into town and getting some plaster of paris. We all walked back up to our campsite, where mom's bacon and eggs were still cooking. For several minutes, we all talk about the huge foot print that we had observed. My father had taken a broken stick and made marks on it to denote the length while we had been down at the creek bed. I remember looking at the stick when! we returned to the campsite and trying to imagine just how big someone had to be to leave a footprint like that. It was at this time that my youngest sister, who was about 3 at the time, began crying uncontrollably. It may not be unusual for a child to cry, but this seemed out of character for her. Suddenly, dad pointed to the valley adjacent to us and said \"look at that!\" Up the hillside, behind a tree, there was a large, brownish haired covered creature that was looking right at us. My other sister started crying at this point, and I can assure you that I too was very scared. At this time, as if the creature were suddenly aware that we saw him (or her, who can tell?) it started walking back toward the main campground road. It's strides were long and it covered a lot of ground, but it was not \"running\". We began packing up quickly and loading up the station wagon. We were on our way out of there in only a few minutes. As we meandered up the camp road, dad said that he saw the creature cross the road ahead of us. I did not see this, but he said that the creature had crossed under one of the inactive lines attached to the poles. Dad later told me that he saw the creature literally lift the line out of his way as he walked under it and then across the road. At a much later date, we did return to Sunrise Beach and we got out at the area where the creature had crossed the road. My father, who stands about 5'5\", took an axe handle and could barely touch the inactive line that the creature had to lift out of its way to cross under it. incidentally, the stick that dad had notched the length of the footprint? 18 inches in length ...",

      "OBSERVED": "Me, my uncle and son was bow hunting for deer and had set us a camp alongside of a food plot that the state park had planted for the wildlife. The day was October the 17, 2014 at approximately 10 pm. We were at camp sitting around the camp fire, when these woops and low growls started happening around us. My uncle went into the camper and got his mag flashlight which produces a very bright light, and started scanning the food plot. As he was scanning it, we saw this reflection which resembled a light shining off of a mirror. Now the reflection came from behind a tree top or brush pile, when we saw it the whole tree top began to shake and move around. Soon the tree top stopped moving and then we heard these footsteps moving through the woods behind the food plot. Well, fear soon set in and we all made our way to the camper went in and locked the door behind us. After an hour or so, I had to bleed my bladder like something fierce. However, after what I saw, I refused to go outside by myself. So with a little persuasion, my uncle and son decided to go out with me. Almost immediately, the woops, howls, and the low growls started up. My uncle just could not resist himself, so the flashlight came on and started scanning the field again. After my business was complete, I parked myself beside the fire while my son and uncle done some more investigating. All of a sudden, hands started waving, and the call come here, come here, was told to me. Still afraid and shaken up by the previous experience, I wasn’t too interested in what they were seeing. However, I made my way over to them to see what was going on. But for some reason, I just could not see what they were seeing. “Look there by the tree, see it, see it.” Soon I saw this movement, like an arm sliding down this tree, and behold there it was, a Big Foot. O my God, I could not believe it, there standing beside this White Oak tree this massive creature was standing there with his right arm wrapped around this tree trying to blend in with it I guess. The next morning we went and hunted again, and on our way back to camp, my son and I stopped on what we have named, “Big Foot Ridge,” because every time we hunt there, these Big Foots just will not leave us alone so we can hunt. However, a BFRO expedition was in progress there lead by Ron. My son and I stopped by to see if they were still there and thank God he was. We told him what had happened, he followed back to our campsite and done his own investigation, which included measuring what we had seen, and the creature stood approximately 7’5” All of my life I have heard tales of Big Foots, personal experiences, and never believed that I myself would ever see one, now I have.",

However, this makes my second sighting of a Big Foot. My son and I was bow hunting in Reynolds county Mo, and I decided to hunt a pond where deer was using it consistently. To make a long story short, I got settled in a tree behind the pond where I could watch a hollower leading up to the pond and a log road running past the pond as well. So around 5 pm I noticed how quiet the woods became. The squirrels I had been watching disappeared, the birds became silent, so I started to become concerned of human activity. So I began to search the woods to see if someone was in the area when this large black figure appeared walking down the other side of this hollower I had set up to watch. At first I thought this was a man. But as it kept walking I noticed how massive it was, and all of a sudden it stopped and took two steps backwards and turned and looked straight at me. It was then I realized that this is not a man but a Big Foot. As this creature looked at me, I could clearly see its eyes and nose. I could see flesh around its eyes and cheeks and also see hair covering its face as well. It stood there looking at me for I guess a good fifteen or twenty seconds, then turned and walked on down the ridge and disappeared into the woods. Needless to say, I was scared out of my mind and refused to climb down the tree, but it was getting dark and I knew I had to meet my son back out on the main road. Finally I got up the nerve and came down. So I walked over to where I saw it and looked back to the tree I was in, and then it became clear that what I had seen could not have been a man, because he would not have been tall enough to have been seen over the underbrush. This creature was at least seven and a half or eight foot tall. When I met up with my son I asked him if he met or passed anybody or vehicles on his way to pick me up, and he said no then I told him what I saw.",

The lake is a small sucluded lake about 10 acres or so and not very heavily used in the Mark Twain National Forest.  There is one road in and about 3-5 miles off the highway.  So I cant imagine anyone out there and if they came down the road we would have heared them unless the walked and it would have been a long walk.  We where all siting around the camp fire talking and something come runing out of the woods.  Just out of the distance of the light of our camp fire and ran down toward the lake.  Where the moon light was the fairly bright.  It ran around that area for awhile almost like it was running circles like it was confused.  It also was waving it arms and making a very strange noise.  Then ran back in the woods. It's appearance was diferent from most that people report.  It was about four feet tall like a baby bigfoot.  It was on two legs and very stalkey and the sounds it made were not like any of the ones on your web sight. A few years back I was whatching a t.v. show that was about bigfoot.  They had some audio of sounds much like the ones you have.  But there was a man in Colaorado that had a recording that was diferent he had it tested by some scientist and he said it was something unexplainable.  But it sounded just like what I herd. Now I dont know what I herd or saw was a big foot. But I know I can't explaing it.  I have done a lot of camping and hunting before and since this and have never seen or herd anything like it.",

The friend's version of the story is more or less consistent with the story told by the witness, so it will remain accessible here.] I worked at plant that produces feed grade Amino Acid additives.  Our company is Japanese-owned and had just expanded, adding a new plant to the existing one.  As a shift worker, we work 2 weeks on the day shift, then switch to 2 weeks nights...it's hell on the body's sleep cycle. Anyway, in November of 2000, a fire started in the new plant and as a result, some of the new hires were assigned to work with us in the old plant while their facility was being repaired.  One night, we were sitting in the lunchroom, around midnight, grabbing a bite to eat.  I made the remark about a \"less than helpful\" co-worker to the tune of, \"he's like Bigfoot, occasionally there's a sighting\", eluding to the fact that this particular co-worker had a tendency to hide on midnights and leave all the work to the rest of us.  We all laughed, but one of the new guys got real quiet and his eyes got real big and serious...then he said, in the most serious tone...that sh@% is for real!  We all got very quiet and as we calmed to listen, he told his story. Now this is a guy who was well-liked because he was such a \"crack-up\" which is what you need to have in the manufacturing sector.  He went on to tell the story of how he encountered a Bigfoot when he was on a date in Chafee, Missouri. Him and his girlfriend were parked on a narrow dirt road, just off a county road near Scott City, Missouri.  They were doing what young folks do in a car on friday nights, and when they were ready to leave, they started the car and turned on the headlights.  About 20 yards ahead, they saw a creature, frozen, looking back at them with yellow eyes.  They couldn't turn around due to the narrow lane, so he put it in reverse and backed out about 100 feet to the road and made haste into town.  He said they were so scared, they believed the creature might be on top of their car, that they drove to a convenience store where a group of people were gathered, in the hopes that if people started to scatter, they were correct in their assumption that a Bigfoot was on top of their car. We all sort of laughed at his story, but he remained serious...and I've got to tell you, this seemed strange, because he is normally a very funny guy and his face was quite sullen as he told his story. I sort of believed him and inquired from some of the others as to what they thought. Some say there is a creature in Southeast Missouri known as Yehoo man, so it's not a new phenomenom.  I've been waiting seven years now and noone in this area has posted any reports of sightings here.  I check this site every once in a while and decided to finally tell this story because I believe the young man saw a Bigfoot and I even had him take me out to the location. It happens to be close to a residence, although out in the country, and located close to a stream with trees on both sides of the lane he claimed to be parked in.  It's just another one of those accounts that will probably add to the mystery of what I believe is the last frontier of animal science.",

The entire region is part of the \"Ozarks\" with thousands of square miles of wilderness. One afternoon Myself and another scout were assigned to go to the next camp over, Camp Lonestar, to work on a Tower-Building merit badge. We got tired of this after about 2 hours and decided to walk the 10 miles back to Camp Frontier where my troop was - maybe we'd make it back in time for dinner. We asked one Scoutmaster if there was a shortcut between the camps, he said yes, and pointed us in the right direction. This trail had been used until 1970, when a flood had washed out a bridge. We proceeded about 3 miles down this trail when the forest canopy became so dense, it virtually blocked out almost all sunlight. The foliage on the forest floor was just as dense - someone standing just feet away could be lost to view. Boulders & fallen trees were so thick the trail was soon lost, but we kept going in a Northeast direction, where we thought our camp was. We then heard a crashing sound through the underbrush coming from the Southeast. We stopped to listen & thought it might be a deer, which are common in this area. It was then I saw something that scared the Hell out of me. I saw 2 \"Creatures\" about 6 feet tall, covered in dark brown fur, about 100 feet away from us. They broke out of a thick stand of trees to my left, running faster than any human being could run, over serious obstacles such as large rocks, fallen trees, & thick undergrowth faster than I ever could. They then crossed the path we were about to take about 80 feet in front of me, ran down rocky, log-filled embankment, JUMPED a 10-foot wide stream, and scrabmled up the other side. They then disappeared into the forest on the other side of the stream. I froze with fear, not believing my own eyes. At first I thought I was looking at Chimpanzees, but these things were taller and bigger than me (I was 5'6\" at 12 years old). These things seemed like they were \"racing\" each other much like children do. I saw them for about 10 seconds before they disappeared, and they definitely were bipedal, similar to Human form, and they were swinging their arms over their heads each time they jumped over a large obstacle, just like Hurdlers would in race. There was no way I was going to go any further down this trail no matter what. We were scared out of our minds, and ran back the 4 or 5 miles to the main road as fast as we could. We then hitched a ride from a Scoutmaster back to our camp. When we returned, we told our Scoutmaster everything we saw. He didn't believe us - neither did anyone else. To this day I think of it, knowing that there is no way a human being could run that fast over logs & boulders & down a steep ravine like that in fur suit in 99 degree weather. When I read some of the other sightings in the southern part of Missouri - I know that there are still Unknown primates in that area.

As I laid in bed I noticed that all the crickets, birds, frogs all stopped sounding or making noise. After about 20 or so minutes I heard what sounded like tree knocks but it was just one knock and I did not hear a reply. The direction in which I heard this sound was right next door on another lot beside mine. I thought to myself was that just what I thought it was a tree knock. I became frightened and I could hear my neighbors shed creak like something big pushed against it. I heard this for several minutes then it went silent again and still no sounds of any birds, crickets etc. The only reason I know it was a tree knock is because I've studied bigfoot since I was a kid, watching stories etc. Then I started hearing russling sounds coming from next door on same side I heard the knock come from. I could hear something pressing against the gravel driveway they have over there. At one time I thought I heard a growl and chewing sounds. After a terrifying hour or so I could hear what ever it was walking but it did not sound like a person, a animal walking. After a few minutes I heard a whooping sound but I did not hear a reply to it. I would appreciate it if someone can call me maybe come out here because today I went looking for signs of what it could have been and found a foot print in the gravel road just feet from where I heard all the noise the night before.

It breathed heavily and it's head was kind of pointed on top. I also noticed that it almost seemed like it had no neck. It stood in front of my window for 2 or 3 minutes like it was listening and trying to look in. I knew it was no joke because we had no neighbors at the time. I was very scared of it. Eventually it left the window and walked around the side of the house. The next day I told my sister what I had seen that night and we discovered footprints around the house. they measured about 20 inches. I never told my parents because I didn't think they would belive me. We also measured the window and discovered that the creature had to be at least 8.5 feet tall.

      "OBSERVED": "At the time of this report, I lived in a home located a couple hundred yards from the shores of Tablerock Lake in Stone County, Missouri. Our house was situated at the back of a long cove and uphill from the lake. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains a zone around the Lake in which no development or clearing of land may be done without a permit so as to maintain a natural forested shoreline. The topography of the area is very rugged Ozark mountains and steep terrain. Large tracts of Mark Twain National Forrest make up the area and most land, even private, is still covered by forest. There was much development of homes and home sites taking place in my area at the time. Around the Fall or Winter of 2002 or 2003, myself and my family members began to hear whooping type animal vocalizations originating from a large tract of woods behind our home. The whoops sounded more mammalian then that of a bird and louder than that which would likely be produced by any readily identifiable forest animal. The calls varied, but often were produced as “whoo whoo whoooooop,” with a rise in the pitch on the last whoop. Around the same time, evidence of a mountain lion or cougar’s presence was found. A couple of neighbors, and a family member, had visual sightings of the large cat. I was screamed at once while in the woods and I had found numerous large cat tracts and claw sharpening evidence. Sometimes the cougar would scream in the evening. A few times the cougar’s scream was answered by the whoops or vice versa. On one occasion I was woken up in the middle of the night by the strangest and creepiest howls. They were very loud and the maker of them was moving very rapidly, up an extremely steep mountainside from the lake cove behind my house and was soon beside and then past my house, still moving up the hill and howling/screaming the whole while. I remember laying in bed thinking “what in the world is making that howl”!? I was honestly too frightened to look out my window into the woods to try to catch a glimpse of the maker. It sounded almost evil or malicious if that quality is appropriate to ascribe to a animal’s call. In the spring of 2003 or 2004, while scouting the back of the lake cove for animal evidence, I spotted a large hominid track. I frequently hiked to this area due to the abundance of deer, raccoon and sometimes cougar tracks that were easily identified in the mud. The footprint resembled that of a barefoot human but was approximately 12 or 13 inches in length and maybe 4 inches in width. Very flat footed if I remember correctly. It is possible that it was made by a very large human, but the conditions in which it was discovered caused me to doubt that possibility. It was a single print, but very clear and distinct. I could easy follow the outline of the toes and boundaries of the foot. It must have been made within days of my discovery of it. It was in the muddy washout at the back of the lake cove, where a small stream meets the cove and releases its silt and debris. The distance between the print and either edge of the washout was about 10 feet, yet there was no other prints in the mud of the washout. My own tracks were discernable in the mud of the washout as I walked about but, my own tracks were not near as deep as the print I mentioned. I weighed about 220 lbs at the time. On either side of the washout is a bare rocky shoreline of the lake. It is very difficult and extremely uncomfortable to walk on the sharp and varied sized rocks of that shoreline barefoot. Whatever left the print must have jumped from one shoreline to the middle of the washout, landing on one foot, only leaving the one print, and then bounding off the one foot  in a continuous motion to the other shoreline, landing on the sharp rocks. The distance traversed by the required leap is a distance nearly impossible for any human to accomplish. I also thought it was unlikely, though not impossible, that any human would even be walking barefoot in that area. It was remote. The only time humans venture into that area is during hunting season or to exit a boat to retrieve or relieve something. Because of the stumps, rocks and other obstacles in the cove, it wasn’t likely that any fisherman or boater was that far back in the cove or that they would venture onto the rocky shore or woods barefoot. I later convinced my brother to come look at the print, which he did. We were both simply puzzled by it at the time. I submit this observation for what it’s worth, to the larger collection of possible evidence. The vocalizations and the footprint may have mundane origins. It is possible that all of this was produced by known animals and/or a very large barefoot human, but I don’t want to rule out any options.",

      "OBSERVED": "It was July, 1978.  My family had just moved from Illinois to Cape Fair, Missouri a few weeks before. Our parents went back to Illinois for a funeral and my sisters (ages 16 & 14) and I (12 years old at the time) were there alone.  It was late at night around 11 or midnight when we all were startled by our dogs barking and growling on the porch.  Normally the dogs would go down to the driveway if they heard something.  This time they stayed on the porch looking towards the front yard barking and growling like I have never heard them do before.  What scared us was that the dogs were scared to go down off the porch. We turned all the lights off in the house and looked out the front windows and door to see if we could see headlights or something outside.  There was a flood light at the corner of the driveway that cast a light on the front yard.  The front yard was all uphill with a 5 ft barbed wire fence separating our yard from the pasture.  The front yard had huge black walnut trees spaced about 30-50 feet apart scattered around.  I was looking out the front window and saw a large figure standing partially behind a walnut tree.  I stared at it a few moments to focus in the dim light to see what it was.  I thought it was maybe a drunk camper who was lost.  You could walk down our back yard to the lake, so I thought maybe someone was looking for a way to the lake through our yard.  People would camp and fish very close by, so we thought somebody was lost.  All around our house it was dense forest and there was only one other house on our 1/2 mile road, so we were very isolated. My 16 yers old sister went to calm the dogs down.  The 14 year old and I were stioll looking out front.  Then after a few moments the figure dashed to the next tree about 50 feet away in about 3 or 4 strides.  I kept looking and before I could ask my 14 yr old sister if she saw that- she ran to the back porch to help my 16 yr old sister with the dogs.  By this time the dogs were freaking out.  Then I looked back to the front yard where I saw it go to another tree, then another tree-zigzagging its way up the hill towards the pasture.  Then to my amazement it cleared the barbed wire fence in one stride and was gone into the night.  My sisters were tending to the dogs so they didn't see all of what I saw.  My 14 year old sister said she saw something by the tree-but she never said anything more than that.  I don't know if they were trying to keep me from getting scared, but I think she saw it too.  I told my parents about it when they got home.  They just blew it off to a city kid seeing \"something\" in the country night.  While I lived there until 1984, I had heard stories of the \"Ozark Mountain Monster\" but thought it was just folklore. I did have several conversations with oldtimers from the area and heard stories of bigfoot sightings over the years, but never had the courage to \"go public\".  I am 37 now and do still believe to this day I saw a bigfoot.  I still get chills when I think about it and am having chills while I am typing this right now.  Too spooky!",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "I never heard anythig except the dogs barking and growling.  We were inside so that's all I could hear. I went up there the next morning and found nothing-I didn't know what I was looking for then anyway-but nothing was out of the ordinary",

He started walking towards the sound then saw something splashing crouched down in the middle of the creek.  He got closer, and then he tripped and almost fell. He  startled what ever was in the creek and it was gone by the time he regained his balance and looked back towards the bridge.  He left right after that.

      "OBSERVED": "Location: Taney County – 3 miles north of Forsyth – under-developed area comprising multiple 10-acre lots, heavily forested, served by a dirt/gravel road. Date: Late summer (July/August) 1998 Time: 8:30-ish pm My wife and I were living in a small \"park\" trailer (8’x30’) on our 10-acre lot just north of Forsyth, Missouri. The area is isolated, almost entirely undeveloped, and composed of heavily forested 10-acre lots. Access to the area was at that time a rather narrow dirt/gravel road which was barely able to handle two-way traffic. The area supports a variety of wildlife including possum, raccoons, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, and a large deer population. Black bears, small and scraggly, are relatively rare, but are reportedly making a comeback in the area and appear to be moving from Arkansas to the south. Both my wife and I had been to work very early in the day, and were quite tired. We were lying in our bedroom at the western end of the trailer with the windows open, reading before turning in for the night. We had small reading lamps turned on; there was still some light outside, but the sun had just dropped below the horizon/trees. We suddenly heard a long, drawn-out scream that was very reminiscent of a woman in fear or pain. Our two dogs began barking fiercely and jumping against their compound fence behind our trailer. The long cry was repeated, this time with an upward shift in tone toward the end, and I was reminded of the call of a peacock. I asked my wife what she thought it was, and did it sound like a peacock. She used to work at an amusement park where peacocks roamed freely, and she said that it was most definitely not a peacock call. When the scream sounded a third time both of us immediately came to the conclusion that someone was in trouble, and we headed for the door. I carried a big, multi-cell flashlight and went out the front door (facing south), while my wife stayed by the door, telephone in hand, prepared to dial 9-1-1 should the need arise. The only clearing that we had done on the entire property was the long driveway back to our trailer site, the actual clearing needed for the trailer itself, and the small amount of additional land clearing that was required for a well house (and access by the well-drillers for their large trucks). I moved westward, perhaps 100 feet, to the far side of the driveway clearing. There are no street lights in the area and with the sun already below the horizon darkness was falling rapidly. I shone the beam of the flashlight across the forested area from which the scream had come, sweeping it slowly left and right. There was a shuffling noise about 50 feet further west amidst a stand of several large cedars and oak trees. I swung the light to the spot where the sound seemed to originate and a dark shape moved behind the biggest of the trees. At the extreme range of the light beam I was alarmed to see two red/orange reflected eyes looking directly at me. No other details were apparent except for generic dark shadow. The two eyes were at a point well above the expected face height for a normal adult human. They blinked once or twice, then vanished as if the owner either closed them fully or turned away. It was growing darker by the second and the only clearly visible area was the cleared driveway and the partially cleared walk to the trailer. All else was in deep shadow. The shuffling noise came again, and a vague shadow moved quickly toward the southwest from behind the trees where I had seen the eyes. I attempted to use the flashlight to see the owner of the eyes, but could only see a tall shadow. It moved at a run, upright, and I initially thought it must be a tall, heavy-set man. I was still thinking that the screams had come from a female and that this must be her attacker. However, there was no one else in the area at the time. The 10-acre lots to the east and west of ours were unoccupied and completely undeveloped. While there is one house to the south, across the access road, it is set back from the road and was dark; the occupants were not home at the time. There were no further calls, screams, or noises in the forest, and our dogs ceased jumping against the fence, but continued to bark and wine in an agitated manner for another 10-15 minutes. I returned to the house and reported what I’d seen to my wife. Without additional information we decided that a call to 9-1-1 was not advisable. Within a week we were attending a gathering of the Ozark Mountain Indian Heritage Association (OMIHA) and recounted the incident to several of the men in the group. More than one described having experienced similar encounters with such an \"animal,\" and one man in particular mentioned that he had actually attempted to give chase with his hunting dogs. The dogs got fairly close to where he suspected the \"animal\" was hiding but then returned to him, tails tucked and whining, refusing to pursue it further. He, too, noted that the eyes reflected red/orange in a flashlight. After that I made it a habit to have a fully loaded Marlin 30-30 by the bedside, but the incident was never repeated; we have not seen or heard anything similar since the original incident. The area is now more populated, all the lots having been sold/occupied, and several of the neighbors have free-roaming dogs. The deer and coyote population is either greatly reduced or they have gone elsewhere to avoid the neighbors’ dogs. We still have possum and raccoons, but they, too, are far less frequent to the area. Note: The air was still; no wind. I did not detect any unusual scents, although there was obviously enough for our two dogs to detect as they were highly agitated.",

There was another noise, something hitting/ bumping the side of the house, the same side of the window I was standing on. Then there was a big shadow moving away from the house twoard the woods. The woods are only about 10 feet from that side of the house and this shadow moved very fast. My husband returned and he looked out the window, saw nothing. We waited looking out the window for several minuets but were able to see nothing.

The night of Monday 15 Jan 2018, was dark - the night of the new (dark) moon. The overnight low temperature was -1° F, and the wind chill was -7° F, and there were six (6) inches of snow on the ground. At around midnight… we heard a “THUMP” outside our bedroom window. Just beneath our window is a large plastic storage box for BBQ charcoal. The BBQ grill (covered with a winter tarp) is approximately 8 feet from the storage box, with an area between for use by summer grill masters. The “THUMP” was the sound of something striking the side of that large plastic storage box - a sound we’d heard numerous times in the past when working around the box and accidentally bumping or kicking it. Despite the sound being a very familiar one, and one which we instantly recognized, it was “out of place” for the middle of the night and both Sharon and I awoke instantly. I said aloud “DID YOU HEAR THAT?” Sharon answered “YES I DID!” I felt the bed tremble several times very slightly… similar to when a heavy truck drives by on the road out front… and I said aloud “I HEAR FOOTSTEPS!” At that point I considered grabbing my handgun to deal with a potential intruder, but the sounds and the vibrations were not repeated. We listened for a few more minutes then went back to sleep. The next day, Tuesday 16 Jan 2018, the temperature never climbed over 12° F, with light winds, but a wind chill that remained at-or-below 0° F. We stayed inside nearly all day, only venturing out on the east side of the house briefly to check temperatures in our out-buildings. Mid-afternoon Sharon asked me if I’d been outside in the yard. I told her that I had not gone out at all except to check the well house earlier. She stood at the bedroom window and pointed to a line of large, widely spaced footprints outside… and said that it appeared that we HAD been visited by an “intruder” during the night. We went out to find TWO lines of tracks coming toward the house from the west, then curving south alongside the house just outside the bedroom window. One of the line of tracks was footprints that were 13”-14” long, 5” wide at the heel, and 7” wide at the toe. Some of those tracks clearly showed individual toe prints. All were smooth, with no pattern or marking and no break between heel and the remainder of the foot (as would be found with a boot or shoe). One of the line of tracks appeared to be smaller footsteps - presumable a juvenile - with clear toe prints showing in some of the footprints. At times the juvenile tracks showed dragging toes side-by-side as if the walker was partially lifted upward so that both feet dragged marks in the snow, side-by-side, before resuming walking. At other points the smaller juvenile prints appeared to indicate that the walker had hopped repeatedly two or three times on one foot, then “jumped” or been lifted, dragging both feet for a distance of some 8 feet, and then planting one foot and resuming stride, or hopping onto the other foot. We believe that one of those hops or jumps resulted in the juvenile bumping the storage box which woke us inside the bedroom, and prompted out vocal comments. Those comments would have been very clearly audible just outside the window. Beside the plastic storage box located beneath our bedroom window the two lines of tracks became a single track (apparently the juvenile was lifted by the larger adult). The stride length of the larger prints averaged 5 1/2 feet as the tracks approached the house. Both lines curved, turning south close beside the house (this is the point at which the juvenile prints appear to show lifting, dragging both feet, and hopping). At the point where the two lines of tracks changed to a single line of large (adult) footprints - presumably due to the adult having heard our vocal comments inside the bedroom, and reacted by lifting/carrying the juvenile. At that point the stride length of the larger prints grew to 6 feet in length, at some points nearing 7 feet apart. There is no indication of running at any point in the larger print tracks, either before or after the closest approach to the bedroom window and the plastic storage box. There were no toe scuffing or heel scuffing as are made by a human attempting to run in the snow. There were “brush” marks behind several of the large (adult) footprints. Close examination of those mark revealed they looked like they were made with a whisk broom with a very light touch. Individual traces could be seen clearly… and it is presumed that the marks were made by dragging hairs that hung from the legs of the creature that made the tracks. The line of large prints made a line heading directly for the roadway - obviously quickly moving away from the house and our voices inside the bedroom. The tracks crossed the road (and were later obliterated in the roadway by multiple visits from the snowplow on Tuesday), continuing at an angle across the yard on the other side. Approximately 100 feet into that other yard, the stride length of the large print tracks slightly reduced, and the smaller (juvenile) prints reappeared. We presume that that larger creature (adult) put the smaller (juvenile) back on the ground. The two lines of tracks continued in a straight line another 300 feet toward a dense treeline. I contacted RON BOLES with the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (BFRO) who had been involved in investigating the traces of activities we have had on our property for many years. While he was unable to visit in person, he arranged for another BFRO Investigator to stop by on the morning of Wednesday at 8am to photograph the prints. Sadly many of the prints in our yard were slightly degraded by wind-blown snow dropping from overhanging trees that eroded the sharper edges of the prints. The track of prints in the neighbor’s yard across the road was not degraded due to an absence of overhanging trees to shed snow. Temperatures later on the day Wednesday, then on Thursday, melted enough snow to remove all but a single handful of prints in the deepest snow in the neighbor’s yard. Those prints, however, were degraded by tracks from stray dogs which appeared to find extreme interest in the line of strange tracks. By Friday virtually all snow had melted and no evidence of the tracks remained.",

On the right side of the road there are some farm buildings, with a row of cedar trees planted right along the right-of-way. As I descended the hill, I saw a large, dark creature above the roadside.  It was upright and appeared to be covered in hair.  It was walking towards the cedar trees, and dodged into them as I approached.  My impression was it was over 6' in height, and rather broad through the chest. This would have been sometime around 6:30 in the morning, and there was only early sun.  Shadows were present as well, but I know I saw something.  It moved! When I got to work I mentioned my experience to a couple co-workers, and got a long razzing about it.  I pretty much shut up about it after that. On the way home that evening, I stopped of at the place where I saw \"it\".  There was no evidence of footprints, but some of the leaves and grass were stirred up as if something had come through there.  In comparing my height to the adjacent cedar trees, I also reaffirmed my belief in \"it's\" height.  It had to have been over 6' tall.

Nobody knew we were going to do this, so there is no way anyone could have been waiting for us in a costume or anything.  Plus nobody knew I even knew how to operate a 4 wheeler (including myself).   We headed out to the woods behind our parents house and half way down a steep hill the 4 wheeler took off flying and when I figured out what gear to put it in the 4 wheeler stopped and my sister and her friend jumped off.  I recall smelling something \"dead\" then I heard something that sounded like Monkeys (yes multiple) fighting.  When I looked towards the trees I see this huge monster walking out.  This thing was at least 7.5 or 8 ft tall and standing straight up with huge long arms and legs. As it was walking towards us it made a deep growling angry noise.  I took off on the 4- wheeler and my sister and her friend were running as fast as they could to catch up.  I looked back a few times and recall thinking- this thing is walking but one of it's steps was equal to 20 of mine.  We were in a panic we were all screaming and the louder our screams the deeper it's growl got. By the time my sisters friend had grabbed her arm and yanked her onto the 4 wheeler, it was within it's arms reach of us but never tried reaching out to hurt us. It was obvious he or she wanted us out of there.  I was only about 13 at the time so I wasn't wise enough to call someone to come research it.

As we loaded up into the truck, I was the last one on since my last name starts with \"Y\", and we always did things alphabetically (significance to come later). It was mid to late afternoon and the trainee I was paired with and I were assigned to guard a bridge crossing training site that army engineers use.  It was the furthest guard site from main post, so we were to be dropped off first to guard it overnight (didn't really need any guarding since it was unoccupied at night and weekends, plus it was in the middle of nowhere - we were doing this merely for the training benefit.)  I don't really have any idea where the site was and didn't really care, all that I knew is that we must've been traveling for about 20 - 30 minutes from main post when my sighting occurred.  It must've been about 1600 - 1700 hours and we were on dirt roads.  I was sitting on the bed of the truck looking out the back, while everyone else in the platoon were able to snag bench seats on either side of the vehicle facing one another.  Everyone else was sleeping or drowsing at the time, except for me in my uncomfortable seat on the bed of the truck.  We came to a \"T\" intersection and turned left. About 30-40 feet from the intersection the other direction, I observed a bigfoot.  What is amazing to me to this day is that I am the sort of person who really doesn't believe anything unless I observe it myself, but at that initial glance, I knew immediately that it was a bigfoot - not a bear, not a big person dressed up, just a bigfoot, no doubt.  A bigfoot was on the road, looked in the direction of the vehicle, and ambled across the road into the woods.  My second thought was to scream and yell to notify someone else in the platoon, but I immediately quashed this idea since by the time I would be able to rouse anyone, the bigfoot would probably be in the woods by then.  No need for me to be rambling on about a bigfoot without any other eyewitnesses in this type of environment.  So I alone observed it. My sighting was of short duration, about 10 seconds if that, and I don't have a lot of details, but I remember that it was tall, had to be at least 6.5 feet to 7.5 feet.  I don't remember any distinctive features, except for one.  Bigfoot had brown to light brown hair/fir coloration.  I though this was extrodinary since every previous thought that I had about bigfoot comprised of black fir.  That's about it, except that during this short sighting, my mind went through all the possible explanations of what this could be besides a bigfoot and dismissed all of them.  No doubt in my mind that I saw a bigfoot. After my sighting, we were dropped of about 10 minutes later and I spent an extremely nervous night in the wilderness at this river crossing sight.  Kind of glad I had my 3 Barney Fife rounds.  I was not really surprised that they called this \"Fort Lost-In-The-Woods\" as a nickname, because it is really isolated.  I have never really made a big deal of this sighting, or do I plan to.  All I know is that bigfoot exists, and I saw it.  I am probably one of the most credible witnesses that I can imagine.  I spent 15 years in the army, most of them as an army intelligence officer, before taking an early out and now I am a civilian working for the Coast Guard as an intelligence specialist in a District office of law enforcement.",

There were no tracks from anyone or anything. It was a fresh snow, not over a couple hours old. I walked to the edge of the woods along the river and found footprints that made me look like a little kid when I put my boot in them. It was like a barefoot person with really big feet. I tracked him for a little ways. He had come out of the wood to the edge of a river bottom field and walked along the egde of the woods, then backtracked himself in the edge of the woods to where if anything were following him they would go right by him. He then bent over some smaller willows and ate the bark off off them. From there he went back into the really thick stuff along the river. I did not attempt to follow.

      "OBSERVED": "My parents had just settled on a new house for our family the day before Christmas.  We were so excited that we couldn't wait, so we moved in on Christmas Day.  There were only two bedrooms in the back of the house, which were claimed by my parents and younger brother.  I was happy enough with a \"study\" in the front of the house, which had very large windows on two sides, practically covering the entire wall area.  Because of the unusual size and shape of the windows, we didn't have anything immediately to cover them, but we weren't concerned because we were in a secluded area off the road and woods all around.  Also, the front side of the house where my room was located, was on a slope, so no one could walk right up and actually see into my room without a ladder.  When I woke up that first morning in my new room, I was excited to see the beautiful layer of snow all around the wooded yard.  I was startled, though, to see a set of footprints coming from the back of the house, from the woods.  The footprints came up along the side of the house and then circled around to my front window.  I told my parents immediately, and my dad went out to investigate.  The footprints were huge, like twice the size of my dad's foot in width and almost twice as big in length.  My dad dismissed it as someone walking through the woods with boots on and not worried because the windows were too high for someone to see into.  The shape was not right for a boot, though. I would have dismissed that completey except that the early summer of 1981 , another incident occurred which my mom, brother and I have never been able to forget or quite reconcile.  We were standing outside at dusk.  My uncle had just dropped by to check on us because my dad had been away on a trip.  He had just driven out of our driveway and we turned to walk back inside.  There was an eery feeling and we all noticed how there was silence.  No crickets chirping or frogs croaking, or other usual evening animal sounds.  Then a monstrous roar came from the darkness of the woods behind us.  No one said a word, we just all three took off running for the front door.  I still get goosebumps when I think about that sound.  I've never heard anything like it in real life ever before or since.  It sent a chill of fear right to my core.  It was deep, and long and powerful.  My uncle did return an hour later and looked around the house with a flashlight.  He didn't see or hear anything.  We dismissed it as a panther scream but never really were convinced that it was that.",

However, between our house and the highway there was a ranch style brick house toward the north of the dirt road.  50 meters to the south of our house stood a barn with a hog pen in front.  The house had a full, flat porch facing the east with four pillars, three steps to the ground and no rail.  My 6 year old sister was closest to the barn.  My 4 year old brother was sitting on the steps.  I was standing next to the steps toward the north.  I heard my sister scream and start crying.  I looked to the barn as a large creature stood there.  It stood a foot taller than the opening of the barn door.  It turned toward the east, its' right, and taking long strides steped easily over the hog pen fence.  When it got to the corner of the barn it looked south then turned to walk west.  Mom came out of the house and told us to stay out of the barn.  Later that day I was over by the barn and saw the large foot prints repleat with toe marks.

I was sitting in the back of an old Chevy Citation at the time it was pretty new, my uncle was driving and my aunt was in the passenger seat and my little cousin who was around 4 or 5 at the time was sitting in the back with me, were coming home and I believe from visiting family or something.  My aunt & uncle lived down this old dirt road around 2 miles and right before their driveway which was on the left was and old dry branch or creek that ran across the road and it did not have a concrete slab to cross over it so you had to slow down a little to cross.  Directly to the right of the creek was an old driveway leading to an old abandoned house which no one had lived in for years.  It was dark so naturally we had the headlights on and as my uncle began slowing to pass over the rough gravel something in the corner of my right eye came into view.  My aunt kind of screamed but not loudly because we were amazed and terrified.  Something that looked to be around 8 foot tall, (I know as a 10-11 year old kid it was huge) came across the branch which led out of the old driveway and not running but walking briskly came directly in front the car.  We all just stared as it was some dream.  It was swinging it's arms a little and acted like we were not even there.  It walked across the creek and crossed the water gate which I don't remeber if it went under or over but what I do remeber is the branch had washed out the bank of my uncle's yard and his perimter fence was quite tall if you were staning in the branch and this bright red haired thing jumped over from the bed of the branch like nothing and into my uncles yard.  Mind you were still watching in the car.  We could see it walk up thru the yard and up the hill until we lost sight of it with the headlights.  My uncle turned into the drive and we had all locked the doors.  My aunt and uncle went thru the count of 3 thing and we open the doors and ran inside.  We got inside and my uncle got his hunting rifle out and went outside with his flood lite and looked for it and on his way back which he didn't walk far he tripped on the chord and it came unplugged then he yelled and got up and ran into the house and locked the door.  To this day if you ask him about what he saw he will say he saw something but he doesn't know what it was or that somebody was playing a joke on us.  My aunt will tell that she saw bigfoot and so will I.  My little cousin was to small to remeber much but I remeber and to this day I don't go out into the woods without a weapon.  To the best of my ability this is what it looked like.  It was around 7-8 foot tall, completly covered in red hair and 1 feature I remember is it looked like it's arms were almost as long as it's legs and that it was not afraid of us.  Also at that time there was a man I do not remember but lived in the area and was at the local store there in Souder, Mo. and was telling everyone he had seen bigfoot and no one believed him so none of us ever made much mention to it except to family or close friends.

I would say it was dark brown, but the moonlight and limited visibility gave it's coat a whiteish sheen. The vehicle I was driving was a 'lifted' pickup truck.  I was able to see eye-to-eye with it.

I expected to see a deer or some other type of wildlife that I was so familiar with. But, I turned and saw what I still believe was bigfoot. It was a little less than a hundred yards away, and walking perpendicular to me. The strides that it took were amazing, so fluid. There was no real bobbing of the head like I have heard of from other sightings, and the arms didn't swing out as much as others have reported, it was very human like. It's body was covered in a brown hair, not a very dark brown though. It was more the color sandstone, that's the best thing I can think of to compare the color. I watched it walk for about a minute, I was to scared to move at all, so I was just kind of frozen there watching it. Then it stopped right beside a large birch tree. I was afraid that it had seen me and didn't know what it would do, so I turned to look up the hill and contemplate running up the hill towards my house or to turn and run back to my friends house. I decided that I was going to leave my bike and run back to my friends since it wasn't up hill to his house. I turned to look back and see where the creature was at and couldn't see it anymore. I believe it hid behind the large birch that it stopped beside.

      "OBSERVED": "It was a dark night and I heard the dogs all barking from their cages, which was not that unusual as they would do this whenever a coyote would come close or a car would drive by. I grabbed my flashlight and turned on the back motion light and went outside with my .22 mag revolver thinking a coyote had stirred them. I hollered at the dogs to hush and they would not at first, but eventually did. It was at this time that I heard something walking in the woods behind the house that sounded as though it was on two legs. I then assumed that it had to be a person and called out asking if anyone was there. Immediately afterwards the walking stopped and I called out again as I began walking towards this little dirt road that separated our back yard from the woods. At this point it sounded as though the footsteps were coming towards me. Not wanting to shoot someone accidentally and still wanting to be safe I went back to the dog kennel and let out our red heeler who I add is usually fearless. I told her come \"come\" and began walking back towards the woods, the dog ran up to the treeline ears pointing up and alert and immediately ran back to her cage. I have never seen that dog back down from anything before or since so I yelled out one more time for whoever was out there that I was armed and to leave now. I heard the footsteps coming towards me again and the time in between audible steps indicated that whatever it was was very tall, at least seven or more feet. I then proceeded to fire two shots at the ground right in front of the woodline and whatever it was calmly began to walk away as though it was not afraid at all. I then put the dog up and went inside the house and have never had any further experiences.",

      "OBSERVED": "November 24, 2017 Two of us were coyote hunting at night on our property. My friend was sitting at the end of the field in a hunting blind and I was going to walk the edge of the woods toward him to try and kick up coyotes. While walking I could hear something walking down in the woods below me, appearing to keep up with my pace. I thought it might be coyotes, so I whistled to my friend. He whistled back and then whatever was in the woods below me whistled. I picked up the pace due to that kind of freaking me out. Twice I whistled, twice something in the woods below whistled. I was close to the hunting blind by then and picked up my friend. We went to the other side of the field and quickly got back to our vehicle. When driving back to my house, we crossed the creek bed and as we pulled into the field right below our house, there it stood. At first, the headlights were not on it and I was trying to figure things out in my head of what possibly could be the big of a creature on our property. It was about 60 yards below our barn. When my headlights hit it, the creature stood there for less than a minute. My friend and I both got a good look at it. It had long, shaggy hair. Its eyes reflected orange. Its arms were attached at its shoulders. It stood 7 1/2-8 feet tall. It looked at us and then, not in a hurried way, turned around and walked back into the cedar thicket. Our border collie took off after it and we grabbed our guns and headed toward where it went back into the woods. Our dog came back rather quickly and we did not go much further. It was gone. This was late at night, but the next morning when my dad went out to do the feeding, the goats usually are very skiddish, but that morning they hugged around his feet and would not let him away from them. We had not told my parents about what we saw the night before because they were in bed when we got back. When my mom walked out of the other side of the house that morning she made the comment wondering about a horrible smell on that side of the house. Two evenings later, my parents were putting Christmas lights on the house and something to the right side of the house, down in the woods, let out an loud long squall. Then the coyotes started yelping on the left side of the field. Another squall from the right side was heard and the horses came running to the house. It was not coyotes squalling. The horses have never been afraid of coyotes. They yelp every night. My parents were both a little on edge with what they heard. My dad has lived in the house for 30 years and is an avid outdoorsman, but never heard anything like that. Since that night, there have been two more sightings within a mile from the first sighting. One sighting was when my friend was heading home and had our border collie with him. He was passing an abandoned home with an open area right across the road. Our dog started going nuts trying to get out of the window. He slowed down and looked and it was on all fours about 15 yards off the road in the open area between two junk vehicles. When he stopped, it stood up and quickly went into the woods. The next morning, my dad, myself and friend went back to check out the area. We found where it had been standing, but it was on grass and just smashed down. It was raining when he saw it, but the area is grassy and not muddy. I saw it again just a couple of weeks ago when I was headed into town at night. It was diagonally across the road from where my friend saw it last. I noticed something move as I passed by and it was standing back in the treeline. My parents have tracked its footprints down in the valley between our house and the field I was walking in the first night. They took pictures, but they are not very good pictures. After we realized that there actually is a sasquatch, we started thinking back about things we just passed off as fluke before. Like having a couple pictures of something unexplained on our game camera. We even joked about, \"Look, we got bigfoot on our game cam!\" My parents go on driving dates regularly. They were on one of their dates two autumns/winters ago and there is a small field they passed right next to our property. There is a creek on the other side of the field. As they passed, they saw something larger than a deer take off quickly. They could not explain what it was because it was not anything normal to them. We told several people about the sightings, but they thought we were crazy, so we quit mentioning it to others. But we did have a couple people who believed our accounts and told us about BFRO. We also have heard of others in our area that have had similar encounters, but because of the disbelief from others have not reported their sightings.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "The night after the second sighting, seeing it between the two abandoned vehicles, my friend came and picked me up and we attempted to find the path that it had taken.

March 2017 Update: My wife and I had just put our boys to bed and returned to the living room to watch TV about 10 minutes later our dog started barking in an aggressive manner on porch which got my attention as well as my boys who got out of bed . I invited our dog inside house and took my spot light out and I came across a large set of orange glowing eyes at least 8 foot off the ground. I motioned for my wife to come out to look at it my oldest boy came out with her.

They turned up missing for about three days. On the night of that third day I had a wind-up alarm clock set inside of a washpan because I was so hard to wake up. Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. my wife shook me awake saying the dogs must be back. She heard some growling noise real close to the house. When I heard the noise, I told my wife \"that ain’t no dog\". It was the weirdest growling sound I ever heard. I jumped out of bed so fast I hit the dishpan and it went across the floor and made a lot of racket. I looked out the window through the window screen and there was what must have been a bigfoot creature of some sort. It was not a bear. It was a very moonlit night, so I know I couldn’t mistake a bear for something else. And it was not human! It was covered in long wavy hair on its body, but much less hair around the facial area. It had a humanlike face and yet it wasn’t human. Suddenly it turned its head (not its body) just its head and just stared in my direction. I started to feel a panic coming on, but I knew I had to do something. I raced to get my shotgun, ran out the front door. I was sure I could reach the yard in time. But it was gone, even though there shouldn’t have been time for it to past the clearing of the yard. So I fired the shotgun into the air just in case it was still close by.

I took off by myself down the road towards the East back to Route 70 to wait. I had been walking for about 25-30 minutes when the wind shifted from the South. I smelled something awful a cross between a skunk and rotten flesh, like something died. As I was walking along the South side of the road I noticed someone walking about 300-400 feet away along the edge of the woods on the South side of pasture. I thought it was kind of late for a farmer to be bringing his cows in as they were in a big hurry to get away from him. About that time I heard a God Awful blood curdling scream which I thought was the cattle screaming. I stopped to look accross at the farmer and he also stopped and stood still looking at me, which I considered odd. As I continued East I watched as he matched my every move and would stop and stare when I did. The cows were gone buy now and the stench was getting stronger as what I thought was a man angeled his way closer to me. I stopped and stared right at the thing ( at that point I knew it was not a man as it was only walking and I was almost running ) it was coming straight for me. It stood close to eleven foot tall and was covered with thick matted redish brown hair. I took off running as fast as I could for the next light down the road. It was a long way off, and as I looked over my shoulder it stepped over a four foot high barbed wire fence with out touching the wire. I knew I was in trouble. I ran for the far away farm house as fast as I could go. My adrenalin going and was scared out of my wits. As I approached the fence to get to the house towards the South, I realized that not only was the house much farther then I thought, but I was met by a pack of farm dogs at the gate. As I jumped the gate ( I don't even think my feet touched the gate ) into the pack of dogs I didn't dare look back. I ran to the home of a farmer and pounded on the door but the farmer would not open the door. I looked at the farmer and I could tell he had seen the creature by the terrified and confused look on his face. I was so scared that I sat down on the porch in a ball and waited for the creature to leave. When I looked up the creature was headed towards the same pasture it had come from with the dogs chasing after it. That was the last I saw of it. I ran and hid behind a tree until my friend joined me. I did not tell my friend what had happened. I have raised three daughters now and for years I told the story of the monster while we were camping. About three years ago I was messing around on the web and came across Bigfoot website. I decided to check in the area and found multiple sightings of the monster at the exact time and place of my misshap.",

Since there seemed to be no source of the smell, we decided to head back up to the car because we knew about the \"Mo Mo\" sightings that had been occuring in and around Louisiana.  No one was at home at my grandparents so we all piled back into the car.  My mom had left down the window and within a few minutes we heard something let out a scream.  My mom said it sounded like a panther scream, but between the horrible smell and the scream we did not investigate, we left in a hurry! My grandma while picking blackberries in this area also encountered the strange smell and may have actually seen the creature out her back door that summer.  She had a lilac bush about 6 foot tall about 25 foot from her back door, one night she was looking out and saw what appeared to be two red glowing eyes peering back at her.  My aunt and two uncles on two seperate occasions encountered what may have been \"Mo Mo\".  Both sightings occured that summer in the evening hours.  Each said they seen two glowing red eyes, and as they drove closer they seen what appeared to be a large, about 7-8 foot tall, hairy creature standing on its hind legs staring at them.  Also, some neighbors of ours who lived a few miles from my grandparents had seen the creature in the garden in their backyard behind their house, it ran away when they came out.  But having just rained, the creature had left its footprints behind.  They had it plaster casted and I actually seen it, it was about 14-16 inches long.",

It looked right into my eyes, I couldn't move, we stared at each other for what seemed like forever but it was probably about 30 seconds, then it turned its head and from a squatting position it jumped up an 8 foot bank and ran in the other direction. I drove back to the campsite and after I calmed down, we both grabbed two guns each and went back to where I saw the creature. When we arrived at the spot it was getting dark and we didn't want to stay around after dark.

      "OBSERVED": "My girlfriend and I both live in a small area, filled and surrounded by hills and forests.  During the summer I would often stay at my her house until midnight before going home.  Often (once or twice a week) I would hear strange noises coming from the woods next to her house as I walked to my car.  It sounded like people laughing, only a little different... it's tough to explain.  It was like laughter, but there was something off about it.  It just didn't sound like human laughter.  The sound was terrifying.  It was almost like it was artificial, but I know that it couldn't have been someone trying to play a trick.  There are very few people nearby, and they're all older people and farmers.  Anyway, the \"laughing\" continued for two or three months.  Eventually, my girlfriend admitted that on her daily walk through the hills she had heard strange sounds as well, but the calls she heard were more like babies crying rather than people laughing.  She also found it to be eerie and inhuman.  she eventually heard the laughter too, as did her mother and one of her neighbors.  it disappeared for some time, but then came back about a few weeks later, just in time to keep her and her visiting sister from sleeping.  After that, whatever it was became more bold.  It started venturing into her yard at almost exactly 2:00 AM every morning.  We would both hear it walking around outside, going through her trash, and knocking things over.  Her dogs would usually get riled up and bark at it for about an hour every night (until it left, I suppose). One dog was apparently kicked or attacked by it, because I heard it being struck and a sharp yelp, then the following day it seemed to limp a bit and was afraid of us.  After that, I didn't really hear much from whatever it was again.  The phenomena went on for over half a year, but as soon as it started getting cold things suddenly stopped.  Maybe it migrated, I don't know.  I don't know what it looked like either, since I never actually saw it.  I tried to find it, but never came up with any physical evidence other than missing apples and overturned garbage cans.  I've figured it was probably a MoMo, or something of that sort.  I can't say with certainty, but I can say that it wasn't normal.  Nothing that lives in Missouri makes sounds like that.",

They had their water hoses ran across the intersection and had a metal ramp laid across the hoses, so that cars could drive over them. It was a very cold night and the water was running across the roadway and freezing. This made the intersection extremely slick. So, this information should be fairly easy to obtain.

We were going from Crocker, MO. to Waynesville/St. Robert, MO. to Wal-Mart.  We crossed the Waynesville/Crocker bridge on Hwy. 17 (North of Waynesville, South of Crocker) and were almost out of the \"Waynesville Corners\" --this highway has several corners and curves after the bridge because it has a bluff on one side and the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River on the other.  When we were almost through the corners and coming up on the \"40 MPH Speed Limit Sign\" which means that we are getting close to entering the Waynesville,  MO. city limits.  It was a winter night, about 7:00 pm and had been dark for about 2 hours .  We rounded a corner and were meeting a car--both of us had our headlights on -- and there in the middle of the road--standing right on the yellow line which separates the two lanes--is this \"thing.\"  It was about 7-8 feet tall and covered with hair.  It was almost \"frozen,\" much like a deer is when the headlights of a car hit it.  My husband was driving and he slammed on the breaks, as did the car that we had met.  At this time, we were just passed the creature, as was the other car.  But, both of us had stopped--and there standing on the yellow line of Hwy.17, and being illuminated by the tail lights of both vehicles--still stood this creature.  It stood there for about 30 seconds and then it sort of leaped off the roadway and into the Roubidoux Creek/Gasconade River.  At this time, I was extremely scared and was pleading with my husband to just \"GO!\"--so we took back off, as did the other car.  We continued on toward Waynesville and the other car continued on toward Crocker.  We did not get out to  investigate, and as far as I know, the other car didn't either. We had no weapons with us (just in case we would need them) and it was dark--and suddenly very eerie.  I have never heard of any  stories of this particular incident, so I assume that the other people who witnessed this had the same idea that we did--NEVER TELL A SOUL--we have discussed this with close friends and family,  but no one else--until now.

Just passed the sighting area, the Roubidoux Creek (a very large creek that is prone to flooding) meets the Gasconade River. On the other side of  the creek is mainly farmer's land--fields and such. About 1/4 - 1/2 mile beyond the creek is another very large bluff with several caves. On the other side of the bluff that is next to the highway is miles and miles of woods, bluffs, valleys, gravel roads, and caves.

We were taking a last minute look at my garden which is very close to the house.  We had only been out there a couple of minutes and then we heard the most unusual screaming sound.  My daughter asks if it was a coyote and I said NO and ushered her back to the house.  The call came less than 150 feet from the house.  It was loud and remarkable.  The dog that usually barks and runs after everything ran under the house. I did not say what I thought it was to her; instead we looked on the internet for sounds that might occur, like coyotes, panthers, fox, Barn owls, etc. After going through the whole directory.  She asks what the sound was.  We then listened to recorded sounds from Big Foot recordings.  Our stomachs turned. Yes, that is exactly what it sounded like.  I have lived in the country most of my life.  I grew up listening to coyotes and the occasional panther, bobcats, owls, Ferrell dogs and deer they all can make weird sounds.  But this, this is crazy.  I never thought that I would hear something like that in my woods.  I live in the river bottoms and I remember when I was young we heard the same sound, that was over thirty years ago. When I thought back on what happened, I realized that before we left the house my inside dog and cat were acting strange, pacing and panting. When we exited the house to go to the garden I should have known something was not quite right.  There were no night time sounds.. No crickets or frogs .. Just silence.. I finally put on my brave face and escorted my daughter to her car and pretended like everything is ok.  I could still hear snaps and cracks in the woods.  I watched her drive off then quickly got back in the house.  In the morning......I'll go look for other evidence, for now you couldn't pay me to go outside and I don't spook easy at all!

      "OBSERVED": "Hi, I am a Corporal police officer in central Missouri. I have had two accounts with bigfoots. First I was night fishing with my uncle when a large hairy thing came down a huge bluff making tons of noise I hit it with a spotlight across the river. The figure was crouched down on the bank looking and rocking side to side. I could not make out a face though. I shut the light off asked my uncle \"what is that?\" he didn't reply. I heard a second one coming down the bluff crashing and bashing. I hit the light again, I couldn't see the other one at that time. I heard a splash as the first bigfoot jumped in water 5 or 6 foot deep and the water was about the bottom of the rib cage. I turned to my uncle who took off running as I followed not looking back. In 2014 My wife and I went hiking as we were hiking I heard a cow growl across the road across 3 fences. I told my wife I have heard it before. I grew up in the country I have hunted all my life I am not scared of any human or animal till these encounters with bigfoot. The growl came across the county road and along the bluff bottom as we walked it traveled over two hundred yards within two min's. It growled again so close my hair stood on end I told my wife get behind me after hearing the growl I pulled my glock 40 ready to fire. I was shaking not with fear with what I heard and could not see. I stood there over ten min's gun ready and never seen or heard the growl again. Now google a cow growling and intense that 5 fold. I know the difference of a bear or a wild pig I have hunted them both I have never seen or heard things like these before. the first property is public the second is private and the third place I will not go into. I will show yo the 2000 acres and send you to where they are but I will not go in there even fully armed. I have been a cop 5 years never pulled my gun once I am not a push over or scaredy cat I will throw down in a drop of a hat. But I am telling you this place where the bigfoots are I will not go no if ands buts about it. I will take you there the rest is up to you guys to get evidence you will get.

      "OBSERVED": "I am a Soldier stationed at Fort Leonardwood, MO.  Every morning we do physical exercises such as running.  That morning we did a 3.8 mile run on the \"Engineer Trail\".  The Engineer trail is a giant 3.8 mile track that has about 10 acres of land in the middle of the circle for land navigation exercises, and towards the back of the track opens up into a giant forest that feeds into Misty Mountain and the outer section of the post.  That land behind the track is 100+ acres I'd say.  On the morning of 1 October, 2014 around 0600- 0615, we (about 15 Soldiers) started our run individually, so we were spread out being some were faster than others.  About midway through the track, we came across a barrier.  A tree about 3-4 feet in diameter that looked to be healthy, not rotten, and relatively in good shape was laid across the track.  We haven't had any crazy wind storms that could've knocked it over, but at any rate myself and other soldiers didn't think anything of it.  As i continued on my run, I encountered another tree that was knocked over but it looked as if someone, maybe some soldiers, had drug it off the road.  Same diameter as the other one, but almost as if someone didn't want us on the track.  I continued on my run and about a mile and half I reached the the back side of the track where it meets the woods that go towards the eastern side of the border of post.  That's when I started hearing a yell that kind of sounded like \"whoops\".  It must've been around 200 feet away.  I immediately stopped running and started listening.  That's when I heard around 5 different \"whoops\".  I say around 5 because each time I heard it, I had to change the position of my head each time I heard one.  3 were from inside the circle of the track, and about 2-4 were on the border of track on the backside.  Being that I was out there alone, (I was in the lead of the pack of Soldiers) I didn't want to encounter what I was hearing I started running to get away from the back side of the track and back towards the civilization side with a quickness.  I know what I heard immediately being that I google, youtube, and watch a lot of documentaries on bigfoot.  The thing was when I got back to the start point, I didn't want to mention what I had heard in fear I might be made fun of or something.  So when the rest of the group caught up and finished.  They immediately started talking about the sounds.  A few of them even mentioned \"bigfoot calls\", with a seriousness.  Most people when they talk about bigfoot, you always get the guys who are sarcastic and snobby.  Well this group of Soldiers we all agreed, there was a family of them out there talking to each other out there on the track. On top of that, I have encountered this odor before when me and my wife will go ride trails on the 4 wheeler, a musky odor.  The entire run, all I could describe the odor as is like a musky/ sewage smell the entire route.  We have ran that route several times, and normally all you smell are the trees and weeds around.  This time it was completely odorless almost to a gagging kind of way.  I wouldn't think twice about saying me and the soldiers I ran with that day encountered a family of sasquatches.",

In this instance, again I didn't so much see anything as hear it. The first incident took place in the middle of November of 2012.  It was in a rural area of Missouri outside the city of Rayville.  The area is a mix of farm and woodland.  It was approximately 9pm when I drove to a friend's house.  As I was walking from my car to his door I noticed what sounded like someone or something big walking about 30 or 40 yards away from me in the woods. It was just beyond the range of what I could see into the woods. When I stopped walking it stopped walking and when I started to walk it began again.  It was only about a 40 foot walk to the door and I walked slowly as I tried to figure this out.  About half way I stopped to think and it stopped once more.  From what I heard it was a sound of only 2 feet walking and was large.  It didn't sound at all like a 4 foot creature like a deer.  I went in to tell my friend but when we came out there was no sound.  About a week later I came out again and was walking to the door and jokingly called out \"are you there bigfoot?\" and laughed to myself. As I approached the door something flew out of the woods and hit my friends car.  Later in the evening when I left, in the distance I heard dogs going crazy and the sound of something large screaming.  It has been several weeks since I last heard anything but my friend says he too has heard the sound of something walking in the woods.  I have thought about if it was a person possibly playing a joke but no one knew I was going there.  Thought about it being another animal but it sounded too big to be a deer.

We had been cutting firewood in a mostly remote area about 100 miles south of St Louis, MO.  It had rained hard all night prior to the morning of the sighting and the ground was well saturated.  The print looked almost like a human print except for the size and the number of toes.  The print was 14-1/2\" long, 4-3/4\" wide and was sunk in the ground almost 2\" deep it had to be something that had a lot of weight to it.  It also had three toes of which the inside toe was slightly larger than the other two.  Unfortunately we did not take a picture or  make a cast of it.

      "OBSERVED": "It was in 1977 and it was late summer or early fall.  I was about 6 or 7 years old and my younger sister and I were looking out our living room window and saw a big hairy ape-like creature walking upright. It walked across our yard and into the woods.  It looked like it came across the road from the angle it was walking but we didn't see it cross.  We didn't see until it was almost to the side of the house, it was only about 100 feet away from us and we got a good look at it.  I still live in the same house where this happened.  It was dusk but still bright enough outside to see well.  It looked right at us and of course it scared us at the time.  We told our mom but she didn't believe us, but to calm us she told us to hide in the bathroom. So we did.  It's hair was a dark redish brown but the red tint could of been from the sun going down. It was about 6'6\" or so, tall, stocky, broad shouldered, hairy, and naked.  It was not human, it had way too much hair for that. Most people in the area do not act too surprised when sasquatch are mentioned. I hope you can prove their existance for good but I hope that they don't get harmed in the prossess. They don't seem to harm anyone or anything and it would be a shame to harm them.  You never hear of anyone human or animal being attacked by them so why should we attack them?  I say take pics and film and sound but don't cage, cut, inject, tourcher, or harm them in any way. Leave them in peace and let them live like they are use to.",

      "OBSERVED": "My husband and I were watching a movie in his brother's barn,  where we have set up a movie projector and screen.  It was during the last half of the second movie, when we started hearing loud splashing noises coming from the lake, not far from the opening of the barn door, where we were sitting.  My husband asked if I heard that, and I said \"yeah, it is probably fish jumping, or maybe a raccoon or something.\" We continued to watch the movie, still hearing loud splashing noises.  As the splashing continued,  it sounded too big and noisy to be fish jumping.  It sounded like something large walking along the shore.  When the movie was over, my husband went up into the loft of the barn to disconnect the projector and computer.  I stood at the barn entrance,  trying to see out towards the lake and see if I could see anything.  While trying to peer out into the dark,  I suddenly felt very uneasy,  like I was being watched.  The hairs at the back of my neck stood up, and I said to my husband \"I really want to you to come back down here!!\"  Now,  I keep horses at my brother-in-laws place, and I am out there all the time, all hours of the day and night.  I am very familiar with this property and the surrounding area, and have never felt uneasy like that before. When my husband came back down,  I handed him a small flashlight and asked him to shine the light down towards where the splashing noises were coming from.  He took the flashlight and walked down to the water's edge.  When he started walking towards the water, the noises stopped.  Then he shined the flashlight and there was nothing.  I was watching still from the barn.  After a second or two,  I heard the noises further down to my right.  When my husband would shine the light, the noises would stop,  then continue in a different area of the lakeshore.  He came back to the barn and said he wasn't sure what was going on, but that it \"definitely was not normal.\"  We both felt a little creeped out, and decided to go home. The next morning, I went to the barn to take care of my horses, and decided to look around the lake shore area and see if I could find any tracks or evidence of what was going on down there.  I came across a very large footprint!!  I stood there staring at it for a few minutes, trying to figure out if I was really looking at what I thought I was looking at.  It looks human in shape, but very large.  My husband wears a size 14 mens, and it was much bigger than his foot.  There were other prints that appeared to be partial, like a heel impression,  a half footprint, etc.  But this one was the only one that I could not reason off as anything else but perhaps a Bigfoot footprint!

It was dark colored and and appeard to be at least 6 or 7 feet tall.  I couldn't make out any real features but it scared the heck out of me and my brother.  I turned around and hauled butt out of there.  I drove through a small creek and up a steep hill to get back to our house, was so scared that I left the 4-wheeler running.

I thought it might be a deer so I turned around and froze. I watched along the top of this dike or levee for the deer to come over the top. As the sound got closer I finally saw a head come over the ridge of the dike. As the form moved up the dike it got larger and taller, it moved over the dike no more than 50 yards from me. I could smell a musky slight skunky smell in the air. As this thing came down the same side of the dike I got down on the ground frozen with fear! I don't remember breathing but thought my heart was going to explode! At the bottom of the dike it stopped and looked around as if it knew something was in the area.

      "OBSERVED": "Many times I have tried to write about this major event in my life, but I find it difficult to tell it just like it happened.  It seems as though I have missed many details. I do not like to relive the event.   Since I can never forget it, I might as well share it with you. I was born and raised on a farm about ten miles from the nearest town in the Ozarks.  The farm had a wooded area that was connected to The Mark Twain National Forest.  I had a neighbor friend that I played with as a child. She lived about a half mile down a gravel road where we would walk back and forth to each others homes. That summer I was twelve years old.  It was a summer evening, and I had walked up to my friend’s house playing. It would soon be dusk and time for me to go home.  I had been taught to watch out for snakes and I kept an eye out for wild animals.  It was starting to turn dusk just as the old gravel road dropped off into a hollow.  It was always a few shades darker in the hollow as both sides of the road were lined with trees and foliage acting as a canopy. I guess I was not paying as much attention as I knew I should have been.  I was watching out for the snakes because the hollow always seemed to have more than its share.  My dad had hunting dogs and one always followed us around.  I could smell the dog.  It smelled liked it had been down in the pond again.  I could hear it walking along with me, just a few feet off, in the woods.  I started calling the dog to come to me, but it did not respond.  I thought this was odd.  The road was coming up out of the hollow, and I started to pay more attention to what was happening.  I could finally hear the dog coming toward me.  It stepped out of the woods onto the gravel road, to my right and just behind me.   The hair on my neck started to crawl.  Something was not right and I could feel it.  I looked down and a little to my right, expecting to see the dog but all I saw was two huge hairy feet.  Suddenly, I turned my head back toward the road and froze in my tracks.  My feet became rooted in the ground as a wave of fear washed over me.   My mouth was as dry as a bone. I could not have uttered a word;   Even though I was so frightened I could not help myself, I had to look.  I had to see what was standing next to me.  I slowly turned to my right again but this time I looked over my shoulder, right into a hairy body.  It was within arm’s reach.  As I lifted my eyes, they traveled up, up as it was very tall;  I saw nipples under a reddish  thick hair, it was not fur. Finally I was looking into a face.  It was watching me very closely.  The whites of the eyes were reddish and its pupils were a bluish color. I looked away and down at my feet. I did not know how I was going to get away from this creature.  It was tall and stocky built. It could have killed me had it wanted to.   I put one foot out slowly and walked as though I had rocks tied to my feet.  The distance from where I first saw the creature and home seem like an eternity.    At last I was to the door of home.   My body was so tense it hurt to move.  I was so afraid but knew I had to look to check where it was.   It was still behind me. I could not allow this thing to enter into my home so I slowly turned my head to look behind me.   I had only turned a little when I saw it standing down the drive a short ways.  There was a cedar tree along the driveway and its hand was close to the top of the tree.  It still watched me and then it just dropped its hand and in about three strides disappeared into the forest.   I then cried out.   It must have been a strange or horrible scream because my dad came running.  I could hardly talk to tell him about what had happen.   He knew something had happened so he got his rifle and searched around the house.   Dusk was falling fast when he returned.   I was so relieved to see him return safe.   He started trying to calm me down and reassure me.   His tried to convince me it could be a bear because everything can be explained.   And maybe I should not repeat it to anyone else.  I know he was only trying to protect me by his words.   It took two years to finally have an idea what it was that I encountered.   Then a TV program came on “The Legend of Sasquatch”.       Then my dad said, “Sis, is that what you saw a few years ago?”     I said, “Close enough.” I have spent a lot of sleepless nights since that awful evening and I have thought of what happened and I wonder what would have happened if I would have reacted differently.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was visiting my Father and Grandparents during a summer school break. I was about 11 years old at the time. (It has been many years since my sighting; about 34 yrs. ago to be exact, but I remember it vividly as it was very traumatic). My Father’s home was in Ridgeway, MO and my grandparents lived about a mile away.  The area consists of vast farmland with many creeks, ponds and heavily forested areas in between. It is a very rural area with a sparse population. I was fishing alone at a pond that was located very near to my Father’s home. The sun was just starting to set, so I decided that it was time to quit and go inside. The pond was encircled with barbed wire and posts for the cows. I put my tackle box and fishing rod through the fence first and then climbed on top of the post to go over the fence myself. Just as I climbed on top of the post to jump over, I heard a loud roar/yell “Raaaah” and looked to see where it was coming from.  There is thick wood land that is on the edge of the property; probably about 100 yards away.  I spotted something on the edge of the wood line as I was on the fence post.   I was shocked at what I was seeing. I immediately knew that it was not a man, but an animal, standing on two legs upright when I saw it. It was standing just outside the edge of the wood line and had roared. It then had its elongated arms raised above its head and waving them from side to side, which it appeared to be alerting me that it was there.  It looked more man-like in face and body, but I knew it wasn’t a man. It was very tall, much taller than a normal man, muscular but thin, with sparse hair covering its body and partial face. The face appeared to be long with a pronounced forehead. The flesh that was visible appeared to be flesh tone and grayish in color. I could see skin through the fur/hair. The hair color was a brownish color with what looked like varying lengths, but very thin.  I only observed it for about 20-30 seconds as I was scared to death. The way that the property is situated is the house in the center, pond that I was fishing in to the right of the house and the wood line to the left of the house.   I had to run toward the house; which was also toward the wood line to escape inside. As I ran, I was too scared to see where the thing was and just made a beeline (tunnel vision) to the door. We never locked our doors there, but as soon as I got inside, I locked all the doors. My father asked me why I was doing this and I didn’t want to tell him as I thought they wouldn’t believe me. That night, I slept in my room on the floor in between the bed against the wall as I was so afraid. I left the next morning for my Mother’s home in Kansas City, MO. I was never so grateful to leave in my life. I had returned to Ridgeway for subsequent visits over the years and I made sure that I was never alone outside again after that sighting. My Father has since moved and Grandparents have passed away. I have not been there since 1986. I would love to go back one day and perhaps try to see it again. There was a small, old non-maintained cemetery that was between my Father and Grandparent’s home.  The wooded area is very dense.  I frequently walked the mile in between my Father and Grandparent’s homes.  Many times on the way, I would stop at the cemetery; which was overgrown with trees, grass and vines and look at the old headstones, many dated back to the 1800’s so I was fascinated. On many occasions I had heard something large moving nearby and always felt like I was being watched. I always thought it was due to the location that I was in, but after my sighting, I could not go there again with or without someone else. I have told my story over the years many times to my husband, and he has been watching BFRO for about a year now and he convinced me to write this report of my sighting for documentation. I carried my secret sighting for many years before I mentioned it to anyone for fear of disbelief.",

      "OBSERVED": "On a real nice night in June about 9:30p.m. myself and some other guys were talking after a softball game on what we wanted to do. So one of the guys suggested that we go to the \"old resort\" to see if anybody was partying there. The old resort was a abandoned piece of land that had a strectch of driveway from a road that went over a hill down a low part and up again. And on top of that second hill was a old empty in-ground swimming pool and a couple of small collapsed buildings. I havenever been there before but heard of others talking about having a \"kegger\" there a time or two. So we all loaded up in Dave's van and off we went, there were 6 or 7 of us. When we arrived there we went over a gate down the hill and up the 2nd hill to the old resort. No one was there but I wanted to see this place for myself, the moon was real bright and your eyes adjusted real well to the lighting conditions and after about 20 min. of \"exploring \" we decided to head back to the van. Now there was 2 guys ahead of us, myself Mike and Gene, and 3 guys in back of us, at about a distance of 25 feet between each of the groups. The two others that were walking with me was Mike and Gene, I'm about 6' 3\" and Gene is about 6' 5\" and Mike was short. As we were walking west towards the van in between the two hills with woods on both sides of the path back to the road. I started to smell the worse odor that wasn't chemically produced. Something like real bad B.O., musky like and fecal. At that point I said \"Gene, what is that smell ? \" and Gene said \"It ain't a skunk but it's just as bad.\" Thats when Mike stopped in his tracks and began looking at our right .We stopped as well and Gene looked where Mike was and said \"Oh my god, look!\"   I looked and saw a figure about 20' from our location staring right back at us. Couldn't make out facial features because the moon was behind it but it stayed behind some brush just checking us out. I looked ahead of us and the guys in front were there and looked behind me and those guys was acounted for also. I said \"What is that?\" and Gene said \"I don't know but I can't handle this!\"  Off he went with me and Mike.  After him passing by the guys in front and when Gene got to the gate he climbed it with 2 steps and didn't stop until he got to the van. I know this because I was right behind him. We waited for the rest and told them what happened. Then I began to rationalize that maybe we just smelled a dead animal and maybe it was just a cedar tree swaying in the breeze.

Between the time I was 14 and 18 from 1950 to 1954 we used to hear the most hair raising screams every so often.They usually come from a forest behind a 4 acre rye field that was just behind our house.First time I heard it, ma and I was cleanen up after buchering a hog.We heard the most God awfull screams coming down from Fry ridge behind our house.The hair went up on the back of my neck and we had 6 coonhounds, and there hair stood up like brillo pads and they run under the smokehouse.Dad laffed it off when we told him but later that night when he was out feedin the chickens it happened again.He come runnin in the house yellin, Did you hear that? Is that what you heard? Man ,he must have some lungs. Another time I was 16 and walking home from my uncles on a pitch black night when I heard that scream up the road between me and home.I froze cause I didn't want to turn around and go a half mile back to my uncles.But I heard the screams again, getting closer.  I jumped a fence into our pasture where we had about 20 head of black anguses and run like hell, couldnt see anything and run right into one of our cows.I fell down into the mud and nearly got trampeled because the cows were running all over the pasture.We heard the screams many times over the years and the neighbors would often talk about it.They always called it, that panthercat. We never heard anyone say theyd actually seen this panthercat or found his tracks.  But there are no panthers in Missouri, except in the ST Louis zoo.Ive since heard cougars out west, and they arent near as loud as this thing was, and every time we heard it the hair on my neck stood up and the coondogs would run under the smokehouse.",

A friend of mine had asked me to drive her to Montana at that time, so we left and I was gone for at least a week.  When I returned, it was around 11:00 at night somewhere around the first part of October 2000. I parked my truck down next to the barn area and walked up towards the house.  Off to my immediate right I heard this hair raising guttural growl.  My mind was racing...was this one of my nephews bull cows, or was it a deer, but none of those fit anything like that sound. I thought my feet would never get me to the door of the house. This sound was done once again. I finally went in and told my family what I had heard. My son-in-law insisted that it must have been a bear. I have hunted all of my life and know all of the animal sounds, including a bear. The next morning I called the Conservation office, and they put a gentleman on the phone and I related to him what had happened. I even made a similance of the sound the best I could. He said that he and his wife go to Alaska all the time to study bear and he had never heard anything like that and it definitely wasn't a bear. The next night, my other daughter and I were upstairs getting ready for bed around 11:00 p.m again and had the windows open. I heard the same sound again out my bedroom window. I quickly turned out the lights, and my daughter crawled from her room to mine to see if she could also hear it. By then, the sound had stopped. Several days later in the eveming, my grandaughter, grandson, and I believe another grandson were playing outside the garage door which was raised up about 3 feet. They heard this loud guttural sound also very close to the same place I had heard it originally and rolled under the garage door as fast as possible. Since that time, several of my family have had some very scary encounters with this sound near their houses. We live in a very wooded cedar and hardwood area with a year round creek. I would like to relate all of these incidents, but they are fairly numerous. I would be glad to tell you, and introduce you to the ones who have had these various experiences. These creatures have lived in this area for many years. My youngest son who is in college now, was out hunting with his friend. They were both about 11 years old at the time, and were hunting up a powerline when they saw what they thought was person, but realized it had hair on it like a gorilla, and it was shaking a fairly good sized cedar tree, which we assume it was trying to shake something out of it. They both turned and left the woods very quickly.",

They were rewarded with a most horrible sound, and it frightened them so much, that the one grandson threw his rifle down as they ran to the house. At this same house, which belongs to my son, his fiance waa lying on the couch about 1:00 in the morning watching T.V. when the dogs next door began barking. She suddenly hear this most awful \"screaming\", and everything became dead silent, then she heard another uproar of sounds like a \"million\" animals howling and over the top of this sound heard another animal crying out as though for help. Then suddenly it got dead silent again. Not too many days after that, my daughter and her hsaband were over there visiting her brother. When they went outside to get into their car, they heard this loud grunting huffing sound almost right by their car. They jumped in and locked all the doors, and left.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was out early in the morning just after daylight looking for buck sign and squirrel hunting.Mainly looking for rubs and scrapes for deer hunting the upcoming season.I was on a hillside overlooking a steep canyon in rough country on the bryant creek watershed.I sit for a spell and was watching the other hillside.I was carrying a browning bottom eject 22 rifle and had planned to harvest squirrels but had passed on several in hope of not alarming deer in the area..I saw a flicker of movement on the adjecent hillside about 150 yds distance.I unlooped my Nikon binoculars from around my neck and looked over where I saw the leaves move.Even though it was late october and a cool morning it hadnt frosted yet and the leaves were mostly green.What I saw was a small sapling move.I saw black fur probably a foot sized patch through the foliage.It was standing still at this point.I thought bear or maybe a cow and was unconcerned.It finally took a few steps and I gasped when I realized it was a upright animal and covered in black fur.It was a dusky black and not shiny.It was moving parallel on the hill and angling somewhat upwards.Id say I watched it for about 10 mins and had never fuly got a look at it even through the binoculars but it finaly hit a small vehicle sized opening and It hit me I was actually watching a bigfoot.It was feeding on something on the ground I believe wild grapes that had fell out of a tree that had vines in it or maybe acorns.It would occasionally look up and listen.A car went down the highway about a half mile in the distance and it looked up and was canting its head to listen.I believe if the car had turned down the gravel road towards us it would have fled.It was only when the car went quiet a ways down the road it continued to feed.It was very large probably 7 foot plus and very broad shouldered.It elbows wasnt like humans it was pointed and stuck back like a deers front leg even when relaxed.It had a crown or slight dome on top its head.A dusky charcoal black with silver beginning at the back of the head and a ridge of fur beginning to get thicker there and widening as it came down the back.The hairs in the elbows and down the back of the leg was longer and the stripe of heavier hair down the head and back was silver tipped.It was somewhat pot bellied but not really.The upper body was absolutely massive.I wouldnt hesitate to say the animal weighed 400 lbs in the least.The nose must have been flat because it didnt make but maybe a half inch bump on its face and I couldnt see any ears at that time...The thumb on its had were more chimp like.Higher on the hand and longer.I think it had 5 fingers and there had no hair on the palms.the hairs were more tapered like claws not human fingernails.It only looked across the valley where I was one time and its eyes were brown and animal like large pupils.It hair up to its lower eyes and a wide mouth.Not much in the way or a chin and its forehead was lined deeply.I was using Nikon zoom binoculars that had 7-15x40 power and was able to see a lot of details.I kept wishing for a camera...After viewing it for Id say 15 mins I heard a vocalization very soft from higher on the hill.I never saw what made it and since I only barely caught it couldnt say how it sounded.But the bigfoot looked that way and stood up and made a return sound that almost sounded like too pieces of hard steel rod banged together.Kind of a ping sound and it walked that way.It had no tail and was very broad across the shoulders.I believe these are a unique species and are pure animal.Not in anyway related to humans.However I think their senses like smell and hearing,eyesight are very acute and they have a lot of intelligence thats why people never see them hardly.They dont want to be seen and avoid encounter with man.Never saw one before and never since.But I dont go into the woods before daylight anymore.I wait till I can see.And if mushroom hunting or looking for indian relics I carry a heavy caliber pistol.I wouldnt want the tangle with one of them period.I never told anybody about my sighting.I figured they would think I was nuts.",

      "OBSERVED": "Hi, my name is Kevin, I'm 52 now. I went hunting with my dad in Dent County near what now is called Lake 117 east of Salem Missouri in Mark Twin National forest. I was approx. 1/4 mile from the old farmhouse up a tree with a view from 10 ft. off the ground approx. Anyhow I remember seeing a doe running by my stand looking scared and then I saw why. It was a tall black man running after it except that was not a black man chasing a deer naked, one went to my left and I could hear loud thrashing in the thick section of woods and I assumed it had caught the animal and was killing it. Astounded I could not believe what I had just seen and then it was when I turned to my right there he stood 20 ft from my tree and was standing there looking at me and I remember thinking who are these black men running naked thru the woods? but wait this was a very hairy being with a type of crest on its somewhat of an oddly shaped head, black hair but thinner in spots and when we made eye contact it growled very deeply. I was so frickin scared I could not understand what was going on, I have goose bumps and fear still to this day 40 years later. I don't like being ridiculed I have tears in my eyes now trying to write this to people that might understand this situation. Scardest I've ever been and in my life time I have had two guns pulled on me, sorry I'm wandering from my encounter. This being of the woods had black eyes and a light tan colored nose that was somewhat triangular looking to me, so this giant tall very strong looking being turned and started running over towards the thrashing sound but I couldn't believe how lucky I felt. Just a step or two and it could of yanked me right out of the tree I was in and soon as it was out of sight I believe I just jumped out of the tree I was in and started running up the logging road back to the farm house where my dad was. I remember stopping and turning around with my dads thirty thirty and I shot in the direction of it and yelling to leave me alone and on the rest of the way back to the farmhouse approx. 300 yds it was paralleling me in the thick woods making all kinds of rackit. I still get scared thinking of this I felt I was lucky that it didn't kill me i was around 11 or 12 and when I finally got back to the farm house my dad was there having a nip, if ya know what I'm saying, he could tell something was wrong with me, and i did my best to explain to him what was going on outside so he headed out. But the beast must have headed back to the deer kill 300 yds away. Umm I'm not sure if he ever truly believed me and that really upset me and I took his whiskey away from him and said now listen dad you have to believe me what I just saw. Well the owner of the farm arrived the next day and he believed me. I was so relieved he truly believed me and i could tell. He was a local doctor and told me he had seen giant footprints in the sand on his beach of his lake what now is this conservation lake he must have left them after he passed away. But I remember him being so interested in what had happened to me and truly believing me. Dang this brings fear and tears too me still the trying too understand, what the heck was going on around me in this deer stand. Never been that scared again, it was so hard to see this and understand that it was real so I've heard that it was one in a million chance of this happening. All I can say is how lucky i was that I wasn't on the menu that day so after analyzing this I truly believe that even though they are giant, inside they won't hurt you but will harass you to leave them alone and remember never look them in the eyes he will let out a very very deep growl and your legs will start shaking uncontrollably. I believe they just want to be left alone, still curious on how humans live. Think about it they could take you with out a problem, you have no chance at all, when I think back about this that is what I have interpreted I guess I would be famous if I had shot it but i didn't have that in me and still don't think i do. I appreciate what you BFRO guys and gals have done except if you would just stay longer in a area that one or more have been sighted that's how you will get your chance at some greater evidence. I wish I had never repressed this memory. Bothers me. Also I see in 2005 a guy had heard one only a couple of miles from where I had my encounter. I believe these animals are in small groups and travel nomadically thru out the thick woods and I guess they eat a lot of deer. I know they had caught one not too far maybe 30 are 40 yds from my stand in this thick woods. I could hear them but couldn't see what was going on. Listen just give me a call and I will tell ya what happened that day. I am ready to discuss this with you pros, dang you guys are so bold. P.S. If you stick with this you will eventually get your film but you have to be ready constantly because they run fast really fast and I also don't believe this animal knows what a trail camera is. Come on just hang in there and be ready and if they are close don't look them in the eyes, he growls unbelievable. Thank you and i would like too try and accompany you guys sometime. I think if someone would shoot one that they would retaliate against humans, they just want to be left alone that's what i believe.",

      "OBSERVED": "I don't know what to think.  I have visited this website many, many times and was impressed by what I have read and the research you do.  I have to add what I have experienced. First a little background on me: I am 60 years old and work for the U.S. Government.  I have been camping for most of my life and was an Adult Boy Scout Leader and Trainer for approx. 20 years.  I have been hunting for over 30 years as well.  I know the animals that inhabit the woods in Missouri. I own 80 fenced acres of private property in the Mark Twain National Forest in Dent County Missouri.  I am bordered on the southeast 40 acres by a farm and on the northwest 40 acres by a farm.  The rest is all National Forest on all sides of my property.  On my property there is a wet weather creek that almost always has a little water in it.  My property is mostly oak forest with about 10 acres of open space that was once used for grazing cattle.  There is a pine foreset on the northeast side where an old logging road is our entrance to the property. I have heard some strange vocalizations since buying the property over 3 years ago.  I have heard the same or similar sounds or \"vocalizations\" on this website.  I know what bobcat, coyote, screech owls, barred owls and most other \"forest animals and birds\" sound like and these vocalizations don't sound like any of these.  I have also heard the banging of wood on trees in the woods around me at night. I was staying overnight at this \"farm/hunting cabin\" of mine on the weekend of 15-17 April 2005.  There was a 3/4 moon out and the nights were very clear and somewhat cool (about 48-52 degrees on Friday & Saturday nights) but I had the window cracked as I like to go to sleep to the \"night sounds\".  I had just gone to bed (about 10:30PM) on Friday night when I heard the \"night sounds\" completely stop.  About 4-5 minutes later I heard an incredibly loud screech or scream come from somewhere close and from the southwest of my \"farm/hunting cabin\" (probably within 200-300 yards at the most).  About 30 seconds later there was an answering vocalization from quite a ways off and to the southeast.  This repeated 4 different times.  Each time the vocalizations got closer together and the one closest to my cabin got farther away towards the southeast.  Between the 2nd and 3rd vocalizations I heard a banging like a board was being smacked against a tree.  There was 3 load bangs from close to me and then three (almost answering) bangs from the vocalization farther away.  After the 4th vocalization (which seemed very close to each other and farther from me) all the vocalizations and tree banging stopped.  About 3-4 minutes later the whippoorwills started in and the \"night sounds\" came back to the woods. On Saturday night it was very much like the night before except there were no vocalizations or tree banging, just the \"night sounds\" ceasing and about 3-4 minutes later the window right next to my bed (on the outside this window is about 4 feet from the ground to the bottom of the window and the window is 2' wide and 3' tall) went completely dark as if something stood outside and blocked out the moon and stars at the window.  This \"blackout\" only lasted for 2-5 seconds. I don't know exactly how long for sure as I was practically holding my breath and trying to be as quiet as possible.  I even reached for my pistol just to be safe.  I had the window slightly open and DID NOT smell anything special like I have read about.  I did smell what smelled like a wet dog and there were no dogs around that weekend.  I should know as I have 2 Labrador Retrievers and a Rottweiler, none of which where with me at the time.  I did go to the door, after the moonlight came back in through the window, and turned on the porch light to see if I could see what had blocked out the moonlight.  There was nothing there and there was not even a cloud in the night sky.  I was alone at the \"farm/hunting cabin\" doing some scouting for the upcoming Turkey season.  The next morning I looked under the window and as much as 10 feet away for any sign of footprints but there was nothing there.  The ground was covered by leaf clutter all around the \"farm/hunting cabin\" and I couldn't find any trace of footprints in the dry  leaves.  I don't know what this was but if someone wants to call me they can",

      "OBSERVED": "It was a Tuesday evening at approximately 6:30 p.m. There were three of us in our deer camp, and three others had gone into town for camping supplies. It was the second week in November, and I was deer hunting with my family (Mom, Dad, & little Brother), and two close family friends in the Mark Twain National Forest approximately 7 miles south of Cabool, Mo. in Douglas County, Mo. My Mom, Dad, & little Brother had gone into town for supplies just after sundown, and left myself, and the two friends (Shawn & Dennis) at the camp site. Shortly after dark, we were all three sitting around the campfire, and heard what we thought was a deer rubbing its antlers. We got up and snuck back behind the tents in the direction of the sound.  We did not have any light source with us except for the camp fire light behind us. The conditions were partly cloudy, and moonlit. Visibility was really good. As we approached the area, what we immediately recognized to be a Bigfoot stepped out from behind a tree. My friend Shawn was 6'8\" and he had to physically lift his head to look at the creature's face. We instantly turned and ran back to our camp where our deer rifles were.The people in the camp next to us fired one shot into the darkness, and was yelling to get their things packed as we ran to the our camp site.  We grabbed our guns, reloaded them, and began piling more wood on our fire. We had three lanterns in camp, so I was elected to take them out into the woods just outside of our campsite on all sides to allow for better vision. We then all sat with our backs to the fire, and our guns in our laps. We began to hear heavy footsteps in multiple directions, and then we started seeing either four of five of these things circling our camp. There was one that was positioned just on the other side of the dirt road that was pacing back and forth, and stopping to squat down and stare for a moment. After approximately 45 minutes of being circled and watched, but never approached in any way, my parents returned. They were immediately concerned about the ENORMOUS size of our fire. We quickly explained what was happening, and my dad decided we should go stay in town for the night. While we were extinguishing the fire, the campers next to us made a hasty exit out of the woods. We grabbed a change of clothes and went to a motel for the night. The next morning, when we returned to camp, nothing had been touched at all. Everything was just as we had left it, including a deer hanging in a tree which Shawn had harvested the day before. My Dad gave us the option of going home, or staying to continue hunting. We chose to stay under the conditions that everybody hunted close to camp for a while. I decided to hunt back behind our camp, where the first sighting occurred the night before. I sat down on a sharp ridge overlooking a very deep, very steep valley. I hadn't been sitting there more than 10 minutes, when I saw a bigfoot ascending the steep slope on the other side of the valley. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I raised my rifle to view it through my scope, and as I watched it negotiate very treacherous terrain with ease, it turned and looked directly at me, grabbed a live tree approximately 5\" in diameter, and broke it in half with one hand. It then turned and disappeared over the top of the far ridge. I hurried back to camp to tell the others, and we went to the spot where I had seen it, and next to the broken tree was a print that appeared almost human-like. Shawn placed his size 16 hunting boot inside the track, and there was a margin of space around his boot of approximately an inch to an inch and a half.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was staying all night at my friend's house located off of KK Highway in Douglas County, Missouri.  This particular friend just lived a couple of miles from my home. She had told me about how she had heard loud, \"puppy-like\" howling noises, and how she always felt like she was being followed when she went on walks in the woods that surround her home.  She smoked, and said that when she was out on these walks she would at times hear something walking behind her, but when she lit her cigarette, the sounds seemed to stop.  Well, being fifteen and stupid at the time, I came up with this idea to go find what ever it was.  I thought that whatever it was had to be scared of fire, due to her whole cigarette analysis.  So, we took some hay from their barn and put it in paper bags.  We put the bags on the ends of thick branches that we found to make these so-called \"torches\".  I secured the bag to the branch on one of these torches with my belt.  So the adventure began.  We headed across their field toward the woods.  It was dusk at the time.  The field was about the one and a half lengths of a football field (I am not into sports, so I cannot really tell you actual feet).  When we reached the edge of the woods, which is where the family dumped some trash, we looked at each other and decided this was not such a bright idea.  We turned around and headed back to the house.  When we were around midway through the field something big and grey came darting toward us from the edge of the woods.  The distance between us and it was probably around 200 feet.  I took off running, without even telling my friend what I was running from; thankfully she followed.  I didn't even realize I still had those torches in my hands, which I finally dropped when we reached the area of the barn, which was about 100 feet from the house.  We ran into the house and stayed there for about 15 minutes, while I tried to fill her in about what I saw.  After we got enough courage up, we went outside again.  We could see about midway into the field a large, grey-colored, ape-like creature squatting down in the brush of the field.  It was just squatting there looking at us.  That was enough, and back into the house we went.  That night, we heard all kinds of commotion outside.  The next morning I had realized my belt was still out there by the barn.  when we went to get it, we found the torches ripped to shreds.  My belt had been torn into pieces, with teeth marks all over the leather clasp.  There were dents knocked into an old car the family had parked in the field.  Later, my friend told me that a little red wagon that was dumped in the dump site was bent in half.  Every time I stayed all night with this friend, whatever it was acted up with this type of behavior.  My friend actually had a calf that died with its neck broken and twisted all the way around after I had stayed the night.  I told my parents about this, and my dad actually wanted to go hunt whatever it was.  I haven't told a lot of people about this, because of fear that no one would believe me.  I go camping sometimes, and I am still very alert to my surroundings to this day, because I never want to see another one for the rest of my life.",

      "OBSERVED": "Overview: Dates - Oct. 17 -20, 2002 Location - Douglas County, MO near Dora, MO - Mark Twain National Forest Campground off CC Highway, North Fork, Campsite #20 (Pine loop). Evidence - Loud calls, rock/boulder throwing, footprints, displaced log in middle of lower trail, multiple incidents. Witnesses - Myself and camping partner, Carl. No other campers were in the entire park on 10/17/02. Incident #1 10/17/02 approx 7:30-8:00 PM After eating dinner my camping partner and I were sitting in front of the large camp fire facing the stream (North Fork of the White river). It was an extremely quiet night. No crickets, or locusts or frogs/toads could be heard at all. It was very quite. We were talking and listening to music. Over the music I heard an animalistic sounding call out of my right ear. I heard it twice before I asked Carl if he heard it. To me it sounded about 150 - 200 yards away, upstream and on the opposite side of the stream up on the bluffs over looking the stream. He said, \"I hear something\". I jumped up and turned off the music. Immediately after turning off the music we both heard a similar call from downstream approximately 50-100 yards away. It sounded as though it was coming from the upper path running parallel to the stream. The campsite (#20 - Pine Loop) was unique as it was created in the middle of the upper trail. In other words, someone walking the trail would actually walk right in the middle of the campsite. The call was very unusual. It sounded initially somewhat canine. When I first heard the second call I was unsure of my original impression of the first call coming from upstream. Carl and I are both avid outdoor/camping enthusiasts. Carl 50-60 years old and has been an outdoorsman most of his life. I am 30-40 years old and have been camping many times as a child, with Carl twice per year for the last 10 years, and with my own family. We have both heard many identifiable animal calls while in the forest. This was an animal call that was unlike anything we had ever heard, or seen on any documentary or while camping. To describe the sound this animal made is difficult. It began the call as a canine type \"howl\" followed by a \"whoop\" or \"bark\" repeated several times. This was NOT a coyote or wolf. The pitch was much deeper and tonal quality gave the impression of something larger than a coyote or wolf. The animal made 2-3 of these \"howl/whoops\" and then was silent. During the silence Carl and I speculated as to the source. We immediately ruled out coyote and wolf as we had both heard those animals in the past. We heard no movement of the animal during the silence - but we were talking/whispering to each other and could have missed any movement sounds. 30-45 seconds after the downstream calls, what we believed to be the same animal let out a call the truly defies description. The animal was now almost directly in front of us if not slightly downstream. The sound appeared to come from the lower path running parallel to the stream just in front of us. This would make the animal approx 35 yards away between the campsite and the stream. The call was another \"howl/whoop\" combination repeated 2-3 times. It was so loud that the echo from behind me was almost equal to the original sound in volume. It was a \"blood curdling\" call. Clearly the animal was either posturing or warning us. I felt the call was directed specifically to us. The call was almost human - but would have had to be a very large tall human. The depth and volume of the call indicated to me an animal of a minimum of 150 - 200 pounds. For the first time in my 38 years, an animal call triggered my \"fight or flight response\". I immediately picked up a large knife and felt an almost over-whelming urge to loudly scream back into the darkness and to rush toward the sound. My adrenaline was pumping. I said to Carl that I felt the sound resembled a large human imitating a wolf. That the call was very \"exaggerated\" and was clearly meant to scare us. We speculated that someone might be playing a hoax on us. Carl responded that he felt this was a close description of the sound. Just as he said those words, not more than 5 seconds after the end of the loud call in front of us, we heard a second animal make the SAME call from 150 yeards or so UPSTREAM. When we heard the second animal make an identical call, we knew we were not dealing with a human prank. I am a musician. The second animal was not a human being. The second animal's tonal characteristics and depth matched the first animals almost identically. We humans have such different voices. I would have been able to differentiate the two human voices from each other if it was a prank. When we heard the second animal we knew we were hearing something neither of us could explain. It was NOT human, it was NOT a coyote or wolf, it could not be explained. The second animal seemed to be giving it's location to the first. The first animal seemed \"male\" or parental. The second animal seemed \"female\". Within 30 seconds, The first animal seemed to have moved from in front of us and was now approx 75 -100 yards upstream and on the opposite bank where it met up with the second animal. Both animals then gave 2-3 howling/whoops. Immediately following both animals began a series of completely different sounds. These were very spooky sounding. The sounds were very fast, gutteral and rising and falling in pitch. It sounded like a language to me. It sounded as though they were having a very emotional verbal argument. It was almost like a cross between a gorilla's grunt and a witch's cackle. Then it sounded as if both animals ran further up stream and over the bluff. The enitre series of calls lasted approximately 5-7 minutes. Incident #2 10/17/02 approx 9:45 -10:00 PM. I had gone into the tent to sleep at approx 9:30. Carl followed a little later - approx 10-15 minutes. Immediately after Carl entered the tent we heard one animal make the same \"howl/whoop\" combination 2-3 times and then silence. It appeared to come from the upstream direction about 100-150 yards away. Incident #3 10/18/02 appox 02:00 AM I was awakened by a very loud crashing sound. I heard the sound 2-3 times before I woke Carl up. The sound appeared to some from slightly upstream - maybe 20 yeards or less. The sound was VERY loud. It sounded as if very LARGE (minimum of 20 pound - possibly 100 pound or greater) boulders were being purposely thrown in the stream. The boulders were so large that the sound had to parts. The first was the object hitting the water, the second was the object hitting the river bed itself. It was a \"Splat-boom Boom\" cannon type sound. Carl had been snoring loudly (as do I) prior to waking up. This sound happened at least 12 times over a 5 minute period. I stated to Carl - \"This shows intelligence and strength\". I believe it was still trying to scare us off. Immediately after the last boulder impact we heard one of two animals make a very brief \"howl/whoop\" (1-2 times). It was as if the animal wanted to place his signature on the boulder throwing. Incident #4 10/18/02 While exploring the lower path 20 yards from our campsite, Carl discovered a large log blocking the path. This water soaked log was completely out of place. It did not come from any surrounding trees. When I attempted to pick it up it crumbled in my grasp. We did not see the log on the path on 10/17/02 - however it was dark and we could have missed it. It appeared to also be a \"message\" - as though something wanted to block our path downstream. Incident #5 10/19/02 10:00 AM While walking on the upper path downstream approx 40-75 yards from our campsite, Carl and I found 2 foot prints. They were approx 14 inches in length. The heel and ball of the print appeared very human like - very similar to \"Big Foot\" prints and casts I have seen in various medias. However, the toes were very different. The clearest print showed this to be a THREE-TOED Creature. I am NOT CRAZY. I could not believe only three toes. The toes were very human if not \"pod-like\" in appearance. We took several pictures of the clearest print. We did not have the materials to make a cast. Carl felt the print might not even lend itself to casting. We did get several pictures of the prints. We could not identify any other charateristics from the prints. I will say this - as with the loudest call from directly in front of us - I believe whatever made these prints is very large. A minimum of 6.5 feet tall and 250 pounds. More likely my \"instincts\" tell me it is 7-8 foot tall and 350-500 pounds. It appeared from the angle of the prints that the animal came down the trail and was alarmed/suprised/angry to see our camp blocking the middle of the trail. The trail was hard packed and yielded no prints. The prints found were just off the side of the trail and in very soft and somewhat wet soil.  Incident #6 Unlike the evening of 10/17/02. The evening of 10/18 and 10/19 brought scattered rain showers. Depsite the rain, the forest was NOT eerily quiet as it was on 10/17. Crickets, frogs, etc. were very loud on 10/18 and 10/19. Strange!",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "Today I searched the internet for other sounds to compare. The Bigfootsounds.com web page has almost identical sounds. The \"whooping\" sound we heard was more \"angy\" and slightly more canine sounding.

      "OBSERVED": "My four year old son and I were visiting my parents who lived in Lonedell, Missouri. My mother was napping, my father was at work (he helped farm there on the land--they lived in a trailer on the about 350 acres owned by their landlord). I was sitting on the front porch with my son and my parent's dog, Buddy. It was mid-afternoon, probably between 1 and 3 pm. I noticed something or someone walking in the field connected to the front yard coming in our direction. My first instinct was to get my baby and get inside. However, I could not help but stand in the doorway, screen door closed but the wooden door open just enough for me to peer through. Whatever that thing was, it kept coming closer to the trailer. By this time, Buddy (the dog) was timidly barking. I could tell from his bark that he was threatened but afraid. I felt bad leaving the dog out on the porch alone, but was too afraid to go out there. The thing (for lack of a known word to call what it was that I saw)was walking, on two legs, aimlessly, not in a hurry and I could not find a reason as to why it came into the yard as it was just looking around aimlessly and leisurely walking. There was a wooden fence, mostly for decoration and only about 20 feet long, that the thing walked next to. My mother had some decorations (can't remember what) hanging on the fence that the thing seemed to look at. The dog barking did not startle the creature, it just kept walking. I was absolutely astounded by what I was seeing; if not for the fact that the dog was seeing it too, I would have wondered if my eyes and/or brain was playing tricks on me. I decided to be brave and opened the screen door just enough to stick my head outside. That's when the thing looked at me, met my gaze. I just stood there, half afraid of it's reaction and it's next move but more curious than anything. My heart was racing. I held my son up to look at it also, still indoors. After it looked at me and yet showed no fear I had more time to study it and I was racking my brain to identify what it was that I was seeing. Here is the best description I can give...It was between 4-6 feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe in very long white hair. It's face was mostly covered in white hair as well, except for it's eyes and maybe it's mouth. It did not have the snout like a dog, it's shape and build was that of a human's. I even compared it to a bear in my head, but their were not enough similarities. This thing was not very animalistic in behavior--the way it walked and looked at me were more typical of human behaviors. Yet, the way it wandered and seemed oblivious to the man-made things around it (cars, the trailer, even the fence) was more like the characteristics of an animal. I did not get the feeling that it was aggressive or wanting to cause harm. Yet, because of the size and animalistic nature of it, I knew that it was strong and could hurt me, my son, or the dog. It began to walk around the side of the garage, out of my sight, but closer towards the end of the trailer that had the bedroom my mom was napping in. I ran down into the bedroom and began frantically looking out the windows searching to see where it had gone. i woke my mother up in my tizzy and quickly told her what I had seen and I wanted her to look. She was still half-asleep and slow to process what I was saying. I did not see where it went from there. I could not locate it through the windows and I was much too afraid to go outside and look. My mom, my son, and I all sat and talked about what I had seen that afternoon. I was still shook up about it. My son was able to confirm to my mother that it was not a dog, not a bear. The fact that we both saw and heard that dog barking at it helped to convince my mom that it wasn't a human or another dog, bear, etc. My mom said that people down the road have two big white dogs--but like I told her, this thing was walking on two legs, not on all fours like a dog. For many other reasons, I knew it was not a dog. I'd never seen a bear in real life before, but I am sure it was not a bear either. I had heard of and seen animated Yetis on a pc game before. That was the closest thing I could match to what I had seen. I knew then and know now that many people do not believe Yetis are real--but whatever it was that I saw that day makes me wonder if they are in fact real and if that is what I saw. I believe it was late summer when this happened. Nice weather, sunny day. Like I said, mid-afternoon and it was out in the open. There were clear farmlands all around us. One pond stocked with fish and swans right next to the end of the trailer that it went in the direction of. There were also two other ponds on the land. I know that a lot of the 350 acres was wooded. Also, there was a road about 300 feet from where the thing was and also from where I was. There was only about 150 feet between myself and the creature. I'm not good at mathematical estimations, but I was as close as I would have wanted to be to whatever that was. It looked as if it could have made about 10 strides to me in a very short amount of time, so I stayed inside. I've read a few of the other sightings here on your sight, but all that I have read are of people seeing creatures covered in dark brown or almost black long hair. That wasn't the case with me. The description of the hair being that it was very long and covered the whole creature, not tangled, matted, or dissarrayed, but it was a blinding white color--didn't even look dirty or yellowed. I wish I could remember its hands or feet, but I can't. I can say that it's eyes were bigger than that of a human's and seemed very dark. Other than when we met each other's gaze, it had it's head looking down so I could not see it's eyes or facial features well if at all. It did not make any noises at all. It hardly made any sounds while walking. This happened about 5 years ago and I have not forgotten it--never will forget it. In fact, my son still remembers seeing it as well. I told my dad about it when he got home--he couldn't tell me what it was either, had not seen anything like that before. I've told my husband, my brother, some friends--no one can relate to what I saw or help me to name what it was. I often wish I could go back to that day and be less afraid and more willing to study it, to even sit outside and watch it instead of hiding inside. I doubt I will ever see anything like that again, and yet I don't know if I really want to, lol. I hope this helps with your work in some way. I had no idea that there have been so many sightings of similar creatures in Missouri and in our country as a whole. I'm going to look through some more stories of sightings after I submit this--I'm curious to see if anyone else has reported a white creature before. It feels great to share my story with someone who might be able to tell me what it was that I saw that day--someone who might have seen something like this before themselves. Thanks, Amber.",

      "OBSERVED": "The Backpack trip Draft 9-8-2014  Background:  Biologist at a major biotech company.  No previous experience with Sasquatch or similar, but have seen a couple shows on television (1 episode of finding BF, and one episode of Survivorman). The Survivorman version was more honest in the “I don’t know what that was” category and peeked my interest; later reminded me of the structure I saw on the ravine trail here.  I have many years camping experience, and some deer and turkey hunting, and grew up summers playing Dan’l Boone in the woods, so I am pretty comfortable in the woods normally.  After this, I really have no interest in chasing BF – but would go there again only if I had a few capable buddies together for security.  On August 31st, I went on a solo backpacking trip on the Wilderness Trail at Meramec State Park in eastern Missouri.  The trail traversed a ~10 mile loop through the ~7,000 acres of protected wilderness with backpack campsites scattered along the exterior circumference of the loop.  I started at the main trailhead at the MSP Cabins parking lot, traveling counterclockwise along the route.  I was on the trail at 4PM sharp, a sunny day with chance of evening thunderstorms, highs in the mid 80s.  Trail goes through a heavily forested area, typical Eastern white oak, hickory, with understory trees and shrubs, poison oak, etc.  – significant areas of the trail were overgrown and thick annual weedy undergrowth, and many creek crossings (soil is moist under the rocks, but almost no areas with clean free-flowing water).  After fifty yards or so there is a trail-use sign-in box; the box was pretty full of hiker slips so I gathered the rangers do not check it often.  Heading clockwise, campsites 1&2 are about ½ mile in, and about 3.5 miles are campsites 3&4.  I ran into two people (day hikers) on their way out near the sign-in box.  Human sign became very thin after ½ a mile, and zero footprints or any human sign after the backpacking camp 2.  I was very much alone after that, and evident with the thick weedy overgrowth (thought path was visible nearly always).  As campsites 1&2 were in a hollow that was muddy & buggy I kept going to campsite 4, which was on high ground with much of the undergrowth removed, and excellent visibility.  No sign of large mammal life save one whitetail deer buck I scared about 1 mile short of campsite 3.  The site looked like it had not been used for a year.  No footprints, disturbed anything, and the piles of logs were pretty covered in fungus.  I decided to go a bit further on the trail looking for fresh water before doubling back to make camp; I was a running a little low on water to enjoy lots of drinks.  After campsite 4, the trail heads steeply down into a ravine following a creek (the creek head is more or less at camp 4).  Going down 150 yards or so down the trail in the ravine, its gets very dark and overgrown, and I got a sudden creepy feeling I was being watched, and I kept halting to listen as I may have been hearing echoes of my own pack squeaking.  Trust your instincts.  Not finding water, and the creepy feeling getting much worse, I turned around heading back up to make do with the water I brought in.  Half way back up I noticed I had earlier walked right by a very strange “structure” formed out of 3-6” thick trees bent and broken about 6-12 feet off the ground.  They were all bent inward towards each other from different directions, still with green leaves, and no other trees around showing wind stress or damage, and this being in a protected ravine, it made no sense.  I’ve never seen it like that before, except maybe where one tree felled another, but not bent and broken midway up the trunk.  Besides, there was no big fell-tree in sight.  I shot a few quick pictures with my iPhone and quickly headed up to camp.  Seems safer there being open and with a homey firepit, and a four-square around it of linearly-laid logs etc.  After dinner, I went to bed about 9.  The sleep setup is a camping hammock between trees maybe 30-35’ from the fire, a bugnet bag surrounding the hammock (dark mesh also affords privacy), and a taught inverted V-shaped tarp over all in case it rains.  I was just getting settled and then endless noises started.  Noises I could not identify for the most part.  Around 9:30PM, it was nearly pitch black with occasional wind gusts very high at the top of trees.  Below me towards the deep woods ravine: and then two loud knocks in quick succession.  I recall how loud, close, and how musical they were, not dull bark on bark, but like a baseball bat against a oak tree, or like the sound wood makes when it is being split by an axe.  But nobody could swing an axe that fast, or just make two swings, much less there was no one within miles.  The knocks were followed by sticks breaking underfoot, and then a loud snort or two like a big deer or horse maybe 20’ from my hammock.  I was frozen to move.  Then someone shook my tarp very quick.  I shone my light and saw nothing (but difficult to get good beam through the bug net).  Maybe ½ hour later the sound of a rock landing and loudly clacking against other rocks in a dry creek 25’ behind me, and something plucked one of the strings on my hammock or tarp (boinnnnng).  Man, something was right there.  Again a quick look to catch something and I could see nothing with my flashlight – but the beam only went about 8 feet at most through the bugnet.  At this point and the rest of the night my heart was pounding, and I was praying for rain to make the things go home. A while later, up on the ridge where the single knock came from, a loud ugly animal scream  - maybe six in a row (like a fox makes, but deeper).  At some point I swear someone was messing with a stick on the fire, the coals moved around like someone threw something at them again and again.  I got an impression this was like kids playing around or something.  At the same time, for at least two hours, the constant sound maybe 30-40 feet away of someone walking around quietly and picking through a rotten log or removing bark from a tree.  Like looking for grubs or ?? There aren’t any woodpeckers a 2 AM – right?  Also, I was surprised that no whiporwhills, chuck-will’s-widow or other birds were making noise.  Come to think of it, no owls either.  Very quiet except for these “things”.  The log chipper was flinging bits and pieces – like small twigs landing on my tarp over and over, but would stop if I shone the flashlight.  The whole thing was like someone messing with me having fun.  I sat motionless. But more of the same went on and on.  I did get the impression someone was more curious and insistent then going to eat me.  By then I had my machete, knife, and flashlight in the hammock with me … but I am a small man. I lost track of what came before what between about 1 and 3, but this went on all night until about 4AM.  Around 2, I heard a fluttering sound about the hammock and tarp (like someone blowing several loose raspberries with their lips bbbbfppppt, and flicking the tarp with their fingers).  This was really annoying.  At some point around 3, I fell asleep exhausted, but awoke to the sound of a dog’s collar tags coming closer jing-jing-JING-JING getting louder and closer – Thank heavens, a dog to chase them away!  But I yelled Hey!, and it stopped instantly. But I found there was no dog, and instead it was my zipper pulls jingling together … someone had been flicking and jingling them only 2 feet from my head.  Later I swear I heard people talking, a woman in a casual conversational tone, like someone hiking to camp (again felt great relief.  But who would be hiking to camp at 2 AM, and it stopped suddenly and nobody was here – plus no lights of course.  I hear her again, and then nothing.  Could not make out any words (at one point I thought maybe someone in the woods was messing with me), but there was no one there and no footprints or otherwise noises that people make.  Whatever these things were, they were fast and deadly quiet when they wanted to be.  Occasionally sticks breaking underfoot, or grunts, but not much.   I’ve heard deer breaking sticks underfoot, and grunting, so it wasn’t hugely different from that – but this is 2-3AM, and kept coming back and they would not do it sniffing around a person’s hammock.  I remember a few other things up on the hill behind me.  At some point lot of loud wood cracking – trees being broken or pushed over.  But I don’t recall hearing the thump of them hitting the ground.  Also, in the great distance over the hill outside the park was some kind of a red-neck rodeo with the sound of jeeps and four-wheelers zooming around, and a few distant trains & whistles.  At one point dogs barking very far away back there, - possibly at the red-neck party but they didn’t bark long just a few times (not a coon hunt), and I recall that really upset whatever it was below me in the woods.  I don’t recall what they did in response, but I made a mental note that they became very agitated at the sound of dogs (possibly just lots of stick breaking).  During a quiet spell, I’d had enough and chanced it to out go pee.  I didn’t see anything, but did find one sock was missing from my boot.  Thinking a raccoon got it, and thinking about hiking back with one sock was memorial (funny and annoying at same time).  But the next morning my sock was back, thrown more or less where it should have been. It is possible I was so tired that I just missed the sock in the night, but I’m not sure.  Again, messing with me.  Later I woke to some scratching on my backpack like someone checking it out (the backpack was right behind my head leaning up against the hammock suspension tree) and then that started plucking at my hammock guy-wire.  With a quick flash of the light it stopped and – nothing.  It was hard to see directly behind me, but no Raccoon either and they always move from people and light.  Either way, in the morning, nothing at all messed with my pack, sweaty clothes still sitting on my pack, or my food bag set 50 feet away – all pristine and untouched.  Very late, maybe 4AM, I hear the scream on the hill again, but this time Much deeper voiced.  Maybe a combination bark and scream.  This one really scared me as it sounded like a huge dangerous daddy.  But nothing happened.  Lastly, I heard the most ghostly howling below me.  Quiet at first, but ghostly, with lots of air and echo, like the way a person would tell a campfire ghost story making a ghost howl, starting high and moving the ghostly echo tone gently lower and lower through all the minor notes.  The long ghostly howl ran twice, then it was over.  I almost laughed as it sounded so fake, and ridiculous after such a long crazy night.  Almost like the Matriarch calling everyone home down the hill now that big daddy was back, and time to go to bed.  In the morning, the rain finally came between 6-8AM, I ran out to cover my clothes and batten-down the tarp and was grateful for the peace under the tarp.  Packing up and leaving between 8-9, I noticed a few other things of note, but cannot tell if they were associated, unrelated, or my tired head. 1. The tarp was last to take down.  Shaking all the rain off, I noticed an extremely dark shape in the open woods back above me and facing me.  Black like nothing else.  Set very low, I thought it might be a huge dark gall on the side of a tree trunk 75 yards away.  I moved around a bit and it did not move or change, so I assumed just a gall that got wet.  In hindsight, there was definitely something about that thing that wasn’t right and got my attention so raptly.  Maybe about the size of a crouching adult person, but fatter and shorter. 2. One of the logs next to the fire had been severely gouged out with bits and pieces pulled out.  But after the torrential downpour in the morning, hard to say when that was done.  But not real long ago as they were colored bits.  I might have a photo of it by accident when I took some last shots of the camp, I can look. 3. On the hill above me, it seemed odd that so many large trees (entire trunks), were laid down in linear piles.  Like piles of 6-10 trees on top of another all on the same direction.  Could have been a logging operation, but there was no logical arrangement of the piles to each other, and no road anyway.  That was another spot that was compelling to check out, but I did not feel comfortable going up there to investigate at all. 4. I looked over the small dry creek bed behind me for heavy deer footprints but I could not find any to explain the huge ruckus all night, and the snorting next to me, and the stone clacking in that area.  But it did rain. 5. About 2/3 mile from the exit on the way out, just before the spur to camps 1 & 2, I heard a crash a large limb falling down and hit the ground just maybe 15 feet off the trail to my left.  Pretty close.  Of course hiking I’m looking mostly towards the ground/trail, not up.  A bit startling, but not totally unexpected if we had a downpour and storm in the morning.  But I heard buzzing nearby, and my feet moved before I knew it (having experienced yellow-jacket nests in the wild before).  50 feet away looking back and I saw that the crashed tree/stick or whatever, had a hornets nest on it and the hornets were making a small black cloud.  Fortunately they hung around the nest area being also confused, I took a picture from a distance and got out of there.  In hindsight, could something have really been trying to send me a message to never come back?  Perhaps I’m over-thinking it.  I was out by 11AM and in a daze for a few days after that… Of all the sounds, the deep cry of big-daddy and the creepy ghost howl bothered me the most.  That or the thing shaking and plucking at my tarp guy lines, jingling my sipper pulls over my head,  and tossing rocks and sticks at me.  I could not explain those at all.   The grunts and first set of screams… could be other animals like foxes, huge deer, a bat fluttering under the tarp… well, maybe, but given all this, it’d have to be grand central station for the zoo.

      "OBSERVED": "On 4-11-03 my son came running to the house screaming let me in..let me in. He was shaking and very upset. He said the woods monster was going to get him. I asumed his older brother had scared him. I confronted his brother and told him to quit scaring his brother. He said he was not even near him and wanted to know why he was crying in such hystericks. When I asked my son again he said it was not his brother...it was the woods monster. I went outside to the back yard, our house sets at the edge of a big woods just up from a river. I smelled something musky, I then had a good idea what he might have seen. My son is 5yrs old, He knows nothing of bigfoot other than the monster truck. When asked again he said it was just looking at him, I asked was he small or...before I could say anymore he said no, he was big like this...pointing to the ceiling in our livingroom. My wife asked, why do you say he...my son replied..he's just like us only bigger. Then I asked him if he smelled anything. He said yes it stunk like a skunk. We laughed at what he said and decided to drop it so he could calm down and sleep that night. The next morning he came to our bed, I asked him if he was going outside today...he said no..then said if he did he would not go near the woods. My wife asked if he could draw what he saw. He said yes. He took a piece of printer paper and got his crayons. He dumped out the crayons and after a second or so said Do you seen the brown crayon. I told him it was still in the crayon tin. He first drew a big rectangle and colored it brown. Then he took the red and drew arms and legs and head. He also drew some squigly line around it, those were the branches he was looking through. Then I got on the computer, I found the picture of the Patterson film. As soon as the picture materialized on the screen my son backed up and said THATS IT. I beleve my son 100% because abot 20-21yrs ago I seen something similar not 200yrds in the same woods. And in 1975 my now brother-in-law saw the same thing not 10 miles or so from here. I just found out today that some people not more than 3 miles from here had some kind of an incident the night after my son seen what he saw. If interested in the other stories you may contact me. I wished that my sons encounter not list any names due to ridicule from people in the area. Myson had to many right answers to what he saw for someone who didn't even know this thing exists. I dont talk about my encounter, and never have around my sons. And we monitor what they watch on tv. He had all the right answers. A 5yr old doesn't just pull things like that out of his imagination.",

      "OBSERVED": "The events of that I am about to relate to you happened on August 9, 2002. just outside of Springfield Missouri. It was about 2:00am. My son and I had driven out into the country to get away from the city lights to watch the Persudes meteor Shower. We drove south on Hwy ZZ and stopped at the top of a large hill. We turned west onto a gravel road and stopped on the top of a hill. There were no close by trees or structures to interfere with our viewing of the night sky. It was a clear night with no moon. After a few minutes in the dark our eyes adjusted quite well. We could see the open fields to the East and south and north of us. Looking west we could see the light colored road going down the hill and off into the distance. After watching the sky for a few minutes I noticed out of the corner of my eye something large moving in the field south of us. At first I couldn't tell if I was actually seeing something or not, when I looked directly at it I couldn't see it but then if I looked  off center of it I could see it in my peripheral vision. At times it seemed to be moving west then east. I realized it was zigzagging back and forth. I asked my son if he saw it but he didn't. About then there was a flurry of shooting stars and I diverted attention to the sky again figuring it must have been a cow or a deer. After a few minutes both my son and I were facing north east when we heard a very deep and loud growl from behind us. Almost together we turned to each other and said\" did you hear that\". Turning around we both could see a large object in the road. We could not make out any details except its outline against the light colored roadway. It was huge, it seemed to have a roughly man like shape but a kind of cone head and extremely wide shoulders. It was swaying back and forth about half way down the hill. After watching it for a few seconds I realized that it was swaying back and forth because it was walking up the hill toward us. At this time it growled yet again, a very low deep rumble like growl. I noticed how quiet everything else was. In fact I remember thinking how funny it was that the thing made no sound on the gravel as it walked. By this time it was getting fairly close, perhaps three to four car lengths away. It growled once again very loud and what seemed unnaturally long. With that my son screamed \"lets get the hell out of here\" We jumped into our car and I floored it down the road and back to the highway. I didn't slow down till we hit town. The next day, (in full daylight of course) I went back out to the spot. I didn't find any tracks or anything. I did however notice that there was a 4 foot high barbwire fence between the field on the South and the road. If this thing was the same thing that I had seen in the field zigzagging across it would have had to step or jump the fence, as the fence was not strong enough for anyone to climb. Especially something as big as this. I do not know what it was but it obviously did not want us there and made no bones about it. I am very curious if anyone else in this area has seen anything similar recently.",

      "OBSERVED": "I grew up on a dairy farm, and would bring in the cows for the evening milking.  This was often done on horse back for both pleasure and convenience. Since I was only ten years old at the time I didn't have to actually milk the cows after they were at the barn, and could ride the horse while my brother and father milked. On the evening of the incident I was riding our appaloosa Gelding south from the barn lot toward the back of our farm. Most of our farm had been cleared by dozing eight years before, but the farm behind ours was completely overgrown,with trees,and brush, and it had not been used for anything for several years. The east boundry of our farm was a river, and there are many caves and sink holes in the area due to the karst topography.  As I mantioned above most of our farm was open so visability is good.  I had ridden about 100 yards west of the barn and was within about 100 yards of the back fence when Ace, our horse stopped walking. I kicked him in the ribs a little to get him going again, but he would only go a step or two and would stop again. This went on fow several minutes with me trying to force Ace who was a very well behaved horse to go forward.  I only managed to get him to go perhaps 20 or 30 yards, before he would go no further. All the while he was stamping his front feet, and snorting air out his nose in great puffs,as well as having his ears laid back against his head.  I was getting very frustrated with Ace, and was slapping the reigns against his flanks, and kicking my heels into him,but he would not go. At this time from behind a small cedar tree a large black humanoid  creature stood up, as though it had been crouched there hiding.  It turned toward the back fence of our farm, being just on our side of the fence.  I took four or five long strides walking upright then jumped the fence like a man would jump over something, rather like a great hop. I didn't get a chance to watch what ever it was because Ace turned and bolted back for the barn, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. I was barely able to stay in the saddle he was running so recklessly. I got my father and brother, and we went back to where I saw what ever it was but it was long gone. I remember that it was not covered with long stringy hair as these things are often reported, but was very dark from head to toe.I saw it from about 60 to 70 yards away,clearly with nothing between us until it jumped the fence. It was probably 6:00 to 6:30 pm, but it was only late September so it was still light out at the time.There were other occurrences in this area with screams, or cries at night, the sound of crashing movement in the brush near our house, and a putrid,rotten smell that when smelled while coon hunting would cause the hound to come back to us, and they would slink around at our heels with their tails between their legs. These things took happened over several years, but mine was the only actual sighting of anything, by my family.",

      "OBSERVED": "Went for a weekend hiking and camping trip with 4 family members.  We hiked about a mile and a half down an established trail before making a turn into the brush to find our camping spot just after sunset on the first night.  we probably hiked about 400 yards into the brush before setting up camp and turning in for the night as it began to rain.  I was woken up about 4:30am by a very strong odor that smelled just like a skunk, so much so that I assumed a skunk had made it into our camp and I zipped up the shell on my sleeping bag to avoid being sprayed.  The odor went away so I relaxed a bit more and tried to get back to sleep when I smelled it again only this time I had an overwhelming feeling I was being watched from directly behind me.  I rolled over to look and was able to make out a sillouette of a very broad shouldered shadow and head between two trees about 7 yards from where I was laying.  I immediately turned around and waited for daybreak, still unsure if I had seen anything or just imagined it I sat waiting and listening for anything aggressive in nature and it didn't happen so I chaulked it up to an overactive imagination but was still uneasy about staying in this location.  I said nothing to my family but I was determined to not let the camp fire die out on the second night.  The second night came and it rained again, we could hear the sound of what I would describe as a very loud owl.  We turned in for the night and all my family fast asleep let the fire get to the verge of dying, easily helped by the falling rain.  Sounds were all around the campsite but not really unexpected in a dry rotting forrest during some steady rains.  I got up to tend the fire and as the firelight grew it seemed the forrest sounds intensified, again probably just nerves.  I'm not an avid outdoorsman but I love the minor amount of time I do get to spend in the wilds.  It was about 3:30am at this time and one of my family members woke up and helped me with the fire, sensing my uneasyness he suggested I use his hammock to get some rest and he would watch the fire.  I got a couple hours sleep and woke up around 5:30am still before daybreak and my family member proceeded to tell me that about 15 minutes prior he heard a very loud crash in the forest and then another less intense crash directly behind the hammock where I was then sleeping.  It had alarmed him enough that he had his handgun out and ready but he said he didn't see anything and I still didn't say a word about what I thought I may have seen the night prior.  I actually did not tell anyone until we were on our way home and I told my brother about what I thought I saw, mostly out of fear of ridicule.  It wasn't until we got home and I started doing some research that I became more convinced of what I think I saw on the first night and what I smelled.  During our time at this campsite the rain stopped during the day and we were able to hike around the area probably covering almost 2 miles and one of things that struck us was the complete lack of any wildlife.  We saw a woodpecker and heard the sounds of birds chirping on the first morning, but that was it, nothing not a single rabbit, squirrel, dear, bird or anything other than that woodpecker and a few fish in a nearby creek were seen in the area.  We did come across some animal droppings that looked almost like rabbit droppings only smoother.  We only stayed two nights even though we had planned on 4 nights total, fearing more rain we left early.",

      "OBSERVED": "Hello BFRO I have something I would like to share with you I believe I have see what people and myself call bigfoot . The first time was on a night time coon hunt. I hunt coons with traps and dogs yet I don't kill them. I let my dogs tree them and I go on to another track with my dog . I had hunted this bottom a night before and my dog was hot on a track deep in the woods bawlen the whole track when he shut up and not a sound from him for twenty minutes. Then all the sudden he came up the creek with his tail between his legs looking back and came straight to me. Ok first this is a hound who has never ran anything but coons and has never stopped tracking with out treeing, anyway, so I thought maybe he got spooked by a bobcat or something so I loaded him up and went home not thinking anything about it. The next evening on the 12th I pulled into the same open field in a bottom where two creeks join. I shined my lights of my truck along the trees of the creeks to see if I could spot some coon and low and behold I saw what I believe was a bigfoot in my head lights at about 75 yards was a enormous blackish brown figure was walking toward the trees through the field to the creek it stopped for a brief moment and just stared at me like it was looking right at me and took large lengthy steps into the woods. I was startled and not only was I startled but my hound in my back seat was startled as well whining and whimpering. I know what me and my hound saw and my dog hasn't ever backed down from an animal as long as I've had it and I've spent countless of hours in the timber with him. [The following was taken from this witness' second BFRO report, after returning to the site :] After talking to the BFRO rep I decided I would go back to the location I had my sighting on the12th, and sat in the exact place I was. Tonight when I got there, there was tracks crossing the road from the north to the south and they were wet and large foot prints. Its 18 degrees here, clearly not a humans tracks. There were 5 prints, one in front of the other, which was rather weird and I do have the pictures of them but their really hard to make out . It was awesome, I got some wood knock responses that were really close across the highway from me, the directions the prints were. I  shined the area and yet I never seen anything. I know what I heard. I'm going to keep squatching the area and a few others to hopefully get a picture of the squatch I saw on the 12th. I consider myself a very very good hunter and I am going to put some of my game cams in the area as well as camo up and sit in the area. I was rather timid tonight on the phone with the BFRO, due to the way people feel about it around here, but I know what I saw and heard.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was taking pictures in the James A. Reed Wildlife Area just outside of Lee’s Summit Missouri yesterday, specifically around Bodarc Lake. I was intrigued since the wildlife area is fairly close to where I live. I decided to take some pictures. I crossed the dam over to the south side of the lake where I encountered two men fishing. I spoke briefly to one of the fisherman about the fish he’d caught that afternoon and the weather which was rather threatening. I wished him luck and headed west along the tree line when I encountered the other man. I spoke, but he seemed preoccupied so I walked on. I turned toward the tree line and started taking pictures into the woods after about the fourth picture I heard what I can only describe as a kind of a grunting snorting sound followed by a low but deep growl it was unlike anything I’d ever heard before. It sounded so close, but I didn’t see anything in the woods. I was petrified I turned and headed back towards the two men. I asked them if they’d heard anything one of the men was a little hesitant and really didn’t answer me the other man said yes it was probably a cougar. I told them to be careful and left just before I crossed the dam I stopped to take a picture of a large footprint in the mud. Already shaken by the experience and definitely inexperienced I failed to lie something down beside the footprint to gauge the size of it. But to be honest the only thing I wanted to do was put as much distance between me and those woods as possible. I crossed the dam to my car it was then I heard the same sound coming from across the lake in the vicinity of where I had been. It was muffled because of the distance, but still surprisingly loud that same grunting snorting growl.  The fisherman must have heard it as well because they were coming across the dam at a fairly fast pace. We didn’t speak again they got into their truck, me into my car and we left.",

      "OBSERVED": "On the 7th of June 2013 a friend of mine and I decided to visit the Monkey Mountain Nature Reserve in Grain Valley as she believed  we might catch sight of a  Sasquatch, since there had been documented sightings  in that area and she knew that I was very interested in the Sasquatch legend. As we traveled down E RD Mize Road towards the parking lot area, we were startled when a large creature on all fours crossed the road less than a hundred feet in front of us.  My friend stopped the car and we watched it cross the road from North to South.  It appeared it had come from a field to the right of us. It was covered in dark hair and very muscular. The back was arched and its head was tucked. I didn’t see a tail of any kind. I did however, notice the hair on its back was considerably shorter than it was on the rest of its body. It seemed to just glide across the road which I though was strange since it was very large. I’m guessing it weighed at least five hundred pounds or more. I reached for my camera which was in my lap but the creature had already disappeared. We continued down the road and reached the parking lot where I asked my friend to go back so that we could look for prints, but she refused. I told her I thought we’d just seen a Sasquatch and she told me it must have been a large dog possibly a Newfoundland because they are large black dogs.  I told her that we had a better chance of seeing a Sasquatch in that particular area than a Newfoundland. It was then she told me that she was going to keep quiet about what we had seen and that I should do the same, which obviously I didn’t do. I know what I saw and it wasn’t a dog, a deer or anything I had ever seen before.",

      "OBSERVED": "I have been keeping this to myself since last year. I have been a deer hunter for over 30 years and wont go back in the woods after what happened. I'm going to bullet point this incident. I was deer hunting. Deer were running around the woods crazy that evening. I had a small buck run past my stand, it was getting dark. 5:30ish. He ran out into the middle of the field and stood there looking at the direction he came from for about 15 min, Then ran off. 10 or 15 mins later I then heard this large something coming through the woods. Small trees breaking and leaves crunching. I had no idea what it was, I had my back against the wide tree 16' in the air, (the tree is wider than my back) and you cant see me or my stand from behind. It stopped right behind me, it is now dark, I could hear it breathing, it was 8 yards behind me, I didn't move, it stood there for about 5 minutes then started sniffing the air like it was smelling for something, then it started to move slightly, it was dry out and leaves covered the ground so you can hear anything move. Then 2 loud tree knocks, I then started to get a chill down my back, as I reached for my bow I heard 2 screams, I had my bow in hand and my shooting trigger was on my bow string and I WAS AT FULL BRAW. The screams vibrated the woods. It stood there pacing behind my tree, left to right then stopped to smell the air again, it started to move West at a regular walk/pace. I let off my bow, reached around the tree, clicked on my head lamp and about 12 yards from me was a 8' tall 700/800lb tall black figure, it grunted when my light came on and ran along the river bank and back into the woods. I did not see a face, I saw the back of IT. I will say this, It was hunting that night, it was smelling for scent and chasing deer, looking for food. At the time my bow was loaded with a 1.5\" expandable broad/arrow head, Yes I was at full draw not knowing what was going on, when my light was on and I drew my bow back again I was ready to shoot if it came back across the stream. I know the exact yards as I have hunted this location for around 5 years, I bow hunt so I need to know the yards for arrow placement. This Sasquatch which what it was, was a massive animal. I don't know if it would harm anyone or persons but the power that I could see it its body was unbelievable. Yes I was scared but I saw something that only a few people in the world have seen.",

I was taking my time down NN traveling at around 30 mph to avoid any deer collisions due to the fact it is deer season.  I had seen frequent deer so I am very keen with knowing what animals in a field look like, especially through the peripheral vision of car headlights. I was about 5 miles from the Franklin County line when I saw a rabbit dart across the road and I slammed the brakes to avoid hitting it. I was at a 5 mph rolling stop when I looked where the rabbit had run from and I saw a 7 to 8 foot tall ape like animal running on it's hind legs at my vehicle as if it were aggressively charging at me. I did not get a look at it's face other than the clear outline of the creature. I was very frightened at the site, and the sense of knowing it was an animal not native to Missouri, and it had just made me start to reconsider what I had just seen. I have recently heard of the Missouri MOMO, and I have been very skeptical about it. I would like to know what animal in Missouri could run at that speed on it's hind legs, surely a Bear cannot. I also cannot understand why I would have angered a Bear in anyway from just stopping in the road.

I spoke out but got no reply. Nothing ran away or moved in the woods. I took it as a warning that I am here, go back, and that's what I did.

      "OBSERVED": "After reading the FAQ section, I have finally decided to tell someone of my \"sighting\". I am not saying for sure it was a bigfoot, but after reading the article you posted about   the young bigfoot caught on a game cam that some people say was \"just a bear\" made me realize that what I saw may have been a young bigfoot. My sighting was actually \"the near miss with a car\" experience. I am honestly not positive of the year, but it was near 1991 or 92. I was driving home from work, alone, about 1am. I had just turned onto the road I lived off of and was going down the first hill. Half way down, something ran across the road in front of me. I hit my brakes, natural instinct, barely missing it I was sure, and then I kept going.  It was merely seconds, but I knew what I saw was not something normal. It was on all fours, but the body and head seemed parallel to the ground, unlike the bears I have seen in zoos. (They seem to have a downward slope from their hip to their head.) The body was not large at the back half but evenly proportioned. The legs seemed to be easily defined. Not real thick at the top tapering down. The only way I can describe it would be that the legs came from the hip, no flap of skin coming from the belly region to the leg to make them look bigger at the body and it seemed the bending when it ran came from the hip and knee area. The thing that has bothered me all these years, the one thing I knew that separates this from your typical animal was the head. It was the way it looked in my direction as it ran. 1) In my experience, most animals running across the road like that don't even look at you.  2) What has bothered me the most, and I couldn't put my finger on til recently, was when it looked in my direction, it didn't turn it's head \"normally\". It brought it's head up a little, but it turned it sideways to see! (picture yourself on all fours, looking at the floor. Without lifting your head, look to the left. That is how it looked my way.) I did see two eyes and a mouth, it happened too quick to get a detailed look , but I saw a face, a face that did NOT have an extended snout. Lighter colored than the rest of the brown colored body. It seemed hairless, but again, I can't be positive how hairless it was. I had a radio on, so if there was anything to hear, I didn't hear it. The next day I drove past where I saw it and saw no signs of anything. Not then , or since then. I am from Muscatine, Iowa originally. We lived not too far from the river, right beside the levee actually, and back in the seventies there seemed to be a migratory path going thru the area. I recall hearing about an encounter with a neighbors dog, and going fishing at night only to be loaded very quickly back up into the truck by dad to leave the area because of large branches breaking in the woods. But in all the stories I have heard, I never realized that a young bigfoot is known to run on all fours so I never made the connection until I read your website. I have always assumed they walk on two legs all the time.",

      "OTHER_STORIES": "This may be interesting as well. Ten years or so prior to my sighting,  a coonhunter we knew came banging on the door very late at night. (Not sure of the exact time) He had been hunting raccoons and had two very experienced coonhounds with him. At the time he arrived at our house, these dogs were shaking in their boxes and couldn't be drug out of them. If you know anything about coonhounds, you will know that they will fight with the most vicious of coons, and not much will scare them, (or their owners). They are usually very well trained dogs and obey commands well. Apparently, while hunting something had made a scream of sorts, a very loud one. I can't describe the sound as it was said to be indescribeable. But it sent those two dogs running, literally with their tails between their legs, for the truck. That was where he found them, he too, hightailed it out of there and to our house with this story. He wanted my father to go with him back out there to see what it was. They both had  rifles and lights and went to where the noise was heard. Whatever it was knew they were there and screamed at them and ran in their direction always stopping short. It made a lot of noise, breaking limbs, big limbs my dad said. It made several charges. Richard(coonhunter) came up with the idea that one of them should climb a tree and the other one back off enough to get it to run farther, hopefully within range of the one in the tree, so they could see what it was. The one in the tree (with a gun for safety if needed) was to shine the wheatlight on it when it got close enough. (Wheatlights are commonly used by coonhunters because they can light up a large area with a lot of light) The first thought my dad had was a wild donkey, not real probable due to the fact that this isn't open country and wild donkeys just aren't here. I think the noise it made gave him that first thought as it was the closest he could get to describe the sound, nothing he has ever heard before or for the rest of his life. Anyway, he said the ground was extremely rocky and if anything ran on it with hooves you would hear the hooves hitting the rocks. The only sound they heard was the trampling of brush and breaking of limbs and after a while they were both convinced it was on two legs and breaking limbs deliberately. I think that assumption is what prompted them to discard the notion of climbing a tree and hanging around any longer. They left it alone. No one knows what it was, you can make your own assumption on this one. My father once told me that the \"old timers\" knew there was something out there but it left them and their livestock alone, so they left it alone. How they knew this and who they were,  I dont' know. This incident would be about 1, perhaps 2, miles from where I saw what I did ten years later.",

At first I thought it was a hunter but realized it was too large to be a man 7-8 foot tall at least and probably over 600 pound ( I'm 6' 3\" and it was taller than me). It had long reddish brown hair kind of matted or curly looking. I was approximately 100 yards from it. I don't know if it saw me or not but it didn't seem to be in any rush to get into the woods. I watched it for at least five minutes before I couldn't see it anymore.

      "OBSERVED": "The sighting occurred sometime afer dark.  I was in my sleeping bag sleeping on a sandbar with three other guys on the Meramec River after an afternoon of canoeing and fishing.  I was awaken and was looking upstream into a beautiful bright, full moon.  The light being given off was so bright, that you could read by moonlight alone.  Suddenly about 20 yards upstream to my left, a very large, very massive creature walking on two legs, stepped into the river to cross.  It appeared to have a very massive upper body.  Because of the moonlight and angle I could see that its body had a very \"furry\" appearance to it. When it walked, I could see its arms sway and its knees bend with every step.  I also noted a very pronounced crest on the top of its head and a very pronounced ridge on its eyebrow line.  I was on my back looking upstream and propped myself up on my elbows for a better look.  As I did this, Greg who was off to my left propped himself up also and said out loud, \"What the hell is it?\".  I answered, not taking my eyes off the creature, \"I don't know, must be somebody ripping off cabins.\" Implying a human form.  Immediately upon Gregs words, the creature turned at the waist and looked at us only taking its eyes off us to look at the other bank when it exited the river.  When it looked at us, its face blacked out due to turning away from the moonlight.  I remember hearing the creature cutting the water, which was about 3 feet deep, as it walked.  The water flow was very fast and no man could have crossed this area and remained standing for very long.  The water came up to the creatures knees.  I could see its knees bend as it lifted them to walk. It exited the river on the right side and we lost sight of it.  This sighting lasted only about 10 seconds, but lives vividly in my memory.  The next morning when Greg and I recalled what we had seen to the other guys, we were severely ridiculed.  Because of this, we didn't go and check for tracks or other sign.  We both agreed that what we saw was not human and far too tall and massive to be a person or bear.  We both then agreed that it had to be a Bigfoot we had seen. I do recall that the draw that the Bigfoot had come out of prior to entering the water was very dark, with thick brush and a spring fed creek in it.  As we were floating by,  I remember having a very uneasy feeling about it as I was looking at it and would not have gone into it.",

We lived on a farm in rural Missouri, not far from the town of Prairie Home. We had a kitchen door that had a window in it that faced out to our carport. Beyond the carport was a two-acre field with trees at the far end. I got a glass of water---my back to the door---when I felt a presence. Well our nearest neighbor was over a 1/4 mile away, and I thought that maybe our cattle had strayed from our bigger parcel into the small 2-acre field. I moved my stool over to the door and got up on it. I cupped one of my hands to cut the glare from the kitchen light on the window. It was pitch black out. I turned on the carport light, and put my face back up to the window---it was still dark for a second or two when something stepped back from the door to allow the carport light to illuminate the situation. The thing that stepped back from the window was very tall---much taller than the standard height of a door---it had been so close to the door that it was blocking all the light from the carport. I screamed, and dropped the water that I had in one hand. The thing outside my door looked right, then left, stepped back a couple of steps---then turned and ran across the carport---and through the field into the woods that bordered it. It was a couple hundred feet from the carport to the tree line, and I saw exactly where it entered the trees. It did not take long for it to reach the trees. Before it ran---it was definitely looking right at me. It had very dark brown, and/or black hair. I could see the reflection of the light from the kitchen in its eyes. I do not remember seeing any white in the eyes. The face had some areas that showed dark skin, with tufts of hair sticking out or surrounding the face and head. I never saw any teeth. Its arms were much longer in proportion to humans. They seemed to hang to the knees. There was long hair at the wrists that seemed to hang down over the hands. When I saw a grizzly bear run later on in life---I thought that the way its hair “flopped” up and down was the way it did on the Mo Mo that I saw.",

We were raising chinchillas at the time, and they have a foul odor to begin with so my dad just thought it was from them (they were in a building only 15 feet from the door). The next day however, we could see were something had moved through the field towards the trees. The grass was over a foot tall, and there was a definite trail that could be seen. There were no footprints---I think because of the length of the grass that was tromped down.",

I was nearing the rounding of a sharp curve in the road which features a gully that empties into a creek, that then empties into an outer portion of the Little Platte River. The area is a mixture of farmland, which is primarily corn or soybean ground, some cow pastures and a mixture of  trees, gully's, and waterways which flow into the river. As I entered the curve my eyes caught a a large shadow as it crossed the road 50 yards in front of me. My initial reaction to this was oh a deer, there are probably more so I hit the brakes a slowed slightly. In the time it took me to blink my eyes and reopen them the shadow had passed completely across the roadway and was at the edge of the ditch, as the distance between us closed and more of the light from the headlights illuminated the shadow. I was able to get a better view of what I was dealing with. What I had thought was a deer was in fact much larger, and upright. As the light caught the side of the creature it made an extremely agile motion which consisted of two steps from the edge of the ditch to the fence line. In the same motion the creature placed its left hand on the top wire of the fence, jumped and cleared the fence with both feet and disappeared into the corn. Description: Height: 7' to 7 1/2' it was very tall Width: Unknown, my view was a complete side profile view Depth: 24\"-30\" easy maybe more Hair: shaggy light red/brown. The hair length on the body, at least the portions I was able to see varied, some portions were longer others shorter. Reminds me of how the hair is on my Golden Retriever in a way. The creature was very stout and the weight had to have been 350-400 lbs. possibly more. I did not get a view of the creature's head or face at all, the face was a complete shadow the entire time and even with the light from the headlights there was no eye glow. The feet and legs were all but blocked from view as well either from the lack of light or from the vegetation once it was in the ditch. The portion I got the best view of was the left arm as it braced the top wire of the fence and made its jump over.  The arm was very large and hair covered, the hair appeared to be longer above the elbow than it was below, with the hair on the hand being the shortest.",

I have played back the events of my sighting in my head again and again since it happened to try to make sense of what I had seen or try to make any other scenario seem be plausible with any other known creature in the area and none of them fit. I was a complete non-believer before my sighting, as I could not imagine in 2014 in a well populated albeit rural area a creature of this size could remain undetected. I would like to have not seen what I did, I was entirely happy with my entire previous 29 year premise that I knew what was out there and how to deal with it all much easier to continue believing.

      "OBSERVED": "This wasn't experienced by me, it was experienced by my father. He related the story to me either later that night or the next day, I don't remember. He and his best friend, Gordon Johnson, often went fishing and (morell) mushroom hunting in the woods near Gordon's house which was just south of town. Gordon had 40 acres, but it was sparsely wooded, and had no fishing ponds. I can't remember whether they were headed for some fishing hole Gordon had heard of or if they were mushroom hunting, but I suspect the latter. The woods they were traveling through were very thick, almost impassible. If I remember correctly, my dad had a machete to hack through the brush. I remember he said that he was having an argument with Gordon, along the lines of \"Where the heck are you taking me!\" After traveling south from the gravel road they'd left my dad's pickup on, he said he found a trail, or at least a spot where the brush wasn't as thick. They started across this spot (I ! remember he said he couldn't tell if it was a trail, or just a cleared out spot) and said they heard a sound that stopped them in their tracks. There had been an eccentric individual that had lived near Gordon who had, a year or so before, let his exotic animal collection loose, which included a lion and lioness. It made all the papers. Despite the fact that all animals had been accounted for, the fact that this sound my father and Gordon heard was a definite roar of some large creature got their attention. In that part of Missouri, bears are unheard of. Forests are pretty much small trees and brush, not the hardwood areas bears like. Same with bobcats, and pretty much any other big game. We have deer and coyotes, and not too many of those. My dad said this was a cross between a lion and a bear, but that it ended in what he described as a high-pitched shriek, like a monkey. Gordon is a pretty superstitious guy, so he totally froze. My dad was more down to earth, he started looking around. They were then hit by a very strong smell, my dad said he almost vomited, he said he was glad he hadn't eaten lunch yet. They heard brush moving (but didn't see anything) and then another howl, just like the one before, but definitely closer. That was enough for them, they turned about face and hauled out at full speed, following the path my dad had cut as best they could. My dad had some nicks and cuts to back up this part of the tale of plunging through the brush (brambles on his clothes and such). They emerged almost 1/2 a mile from where they entered, that's how fast they were running. My father was a construction worker, and just not afraid of much, especially with a machete in his hand. He was also NOT a storyteller, at ALL. If something scared him, he was more likely to lie and say he WASN'T scared, he was quite the macho type. Also, every time he drove past that section of woods to Gordon's house, he always sped up. I could tell something back there got to him. He passed away a few years ago, or I'd call him and get more details for you.",

      "OBSERVED": "One summer while I was in college, (1973) I was living at the Lake of the Ozarks with my high school friend at a house his father owned near Purvis Point. We were both from Kansas City, so it was a second home for them. I had been at the house many times over the years in High School and college. We had always talked about climbing the log flue which was a long scar in on a steep hillside you could see from the Lighthouse Marina looking east across the main channel as the lake makes the turn around the bend. This would be the closest thing to a mountain climbing adventure that the midwest would offer. One afternoon we took his small aluminum fishing boat over to the base of the flue and as we started getting closer to shore and approaching slowly, I kept hearing little pfft sounds in the water around us. Whenever I would look over I would just see bubbles, but no splash so I thought it was some sort of fish. We pulled up to shore and tied up the boat. The hillside was quite steep but still climbable and fully forested with deciduous trees, but not too dense to make walking a problem. Within a few feet of starting to climb and a few minutes of being there, rocks started falling around us coming down through the trees from up above. We did not know what was above us if there were any roads on the high ridge where people would be. So we started shouting up the hill that we were down there, and stop throwing rocks. The rocks were at first half a fist sized, but started getting larger after that, and soon there were football sized rocks crashing through the trees around us, coming downward from above. We quickly got scared and got back in the boat before we got hit by one, since they were large enough to kill us. The smaller rocks continued to fall in the water around us as we pulled away with one or two landing in the boat. At the time we wrote it off as possibly someone having a whiskey still or marijuana patch they were protecting. Although we could never see any smoke in that area or clearings of any sort. After watching Finding Bigfoot a few years ago and seeing how rock throwing is a common trait of sasquatch,  I emailed my friend who still lives near Kansas City, (I moved to California after College) and told him I think it was a Bigfoot encounter we had. Then last night I saw your show from the Ozarks telling about others having Bigfoot encounters with rock throwing, so I thought I would write to you. I am 60 now, but never forgot it. In the 1970s we had heard of bigfoot, but thought they were only in the Himalayas or Pacific Northwest. There was never any talk of Bigfoot in that area, and in fact I never heard any coyotes while in the Ozarks either.  It is still uninhabited there, although many homes have been built in the area that were not there in the 1970s.",

We were 2ish miles down the road when I see a huge brown object 20ish feet off the side of the road in the yard of a house that no one lived in.  I see a humanoid creature on it's hands and knees in front of a big round hay bale. left arm straight down, right arm extended picking up something off the ground. Right knee straight down, left leg extended as if to counterbalance itself. I saw it so clearly that I seen the expression on its face(soft looking, lighter brown hair on the face with a black nose)from a profile angle. It was totally engrossed in what it was picking up off the ground. From the extended arm I saw long darker brown hair maybe 12 inches long blowing in the wind. The hair was not matted and seemed to be clean and shiny. I quickly surveyed the surroundings to get a idea of the size of this thing. it's extended arm stretched maybe 2 feet in front of the hay bale, the extended leg probably 3 and a half feet the other way. It's back was flush with the top of the hay bale. I was unable to speak for a couple of seconds. When I regained control of my vocal cords I told my girlfriend about what I saw. She looks in the rear view mirror and seen the creature by the hay bale then exclaimed she was turning around! Some cuss words followed with the threat to throw her out of the car if she stopped. The creature didn't even seem to notice us or care about anything but what ever it was doing. we was in a small car (94 Mazda 323)and who knows what would have happened if we startled the thing and it came after us.

      "OBSERVED": "When I was just a small boy, my mother and father would tell us kids a story which they had truly experienced when they were a young couple just starting out in life.  They were married in the year 1932.  Shortly there after, they went with their friends, another couple of their age group to a logging camp.  This logging camp was several cabins where two couples stayed per cabin.  The men would leave and go logging during the day.  Then, they returned at evening.  It all started one Saturday night.  The men came in from work and decided to go to town to have a good time, leaving their wives behind.  My mother told me that the other couple had only been married for a short period of time; their names were Frank and Lucy G********.  Lucy was extremely jealous and was afraid that someone would steal her husband, Frank.  It was almost dark when the men left for town.  Lucy was setting on the backporch steps, her arms wrapped around her knees, her head buried into her arms crying.  It was at this point that a curious, hairy man like beast came up to her.  Lucy screamed; the creature fled.  She was the only person in the camp that saw the monster.  She told her story and all the rest of the camp had big laugh.  My mother said “But it wasn’t long that they all got to see it.”  My mother and dad said they seen it several times.  Dad said it would come out about dusk.  Dad said he would park his old truck about 200’or so from the cabin.   And the thing, (mom and dad didn’t know what to call it, “this thing” they would call it) would come out of the woods and dad said it would put its elbow on the bed of his truck and rest his chin in his hand.  Mom and dad said it was bigger that a man and had hair all over its body.  They said it looked something like a gorilla.  Dad said it look a little like it didn’t have a head, its head was down in its shoulders.  They said it would run up right and very fast; dad said the dogs would chase it sometimes and it would just out run the dogs quickly.  Dad would say “Those dogs could chase down a rabbit but they couldn’t keep up with that thing.”  My mom said that some of the men were going to shoot it but my dad said that he would not let them.  My dad said “It looked too much like a human.  My mom and dad would confirm what each other would say. I was about nine or ten when I first heard the story.  After I become an adult I would ask them about it, and they would tell me again.  My dad was not a joker or didn’t kid around he took life serious, he became a Baptist Minster at an young age.  He past away in 1985, my mother in 2004.  they both were God fearing people.   The legacy they leave behind is my proof of this story authenticity. My mother and father had told me this story before I had heard of Big Foot, Abominable Snowman, or Sasquatch and I don’t believe they had heard of such neither.",

I realize I was young, however, I have thought about this experience many times over the years and have not been able to explain what was seen that day. I was with two other people, one female who was my age at the time and her brother who was about 13-14 years old. The two of us girls were walking and he was on a bike. We were on the outskirts of Columbia, MO, I am not sure of the exact location but I did force my dad to walk that path with me again in the days after so I'm sure he would remember. The bike path was wooded on both sides, the weather that day was overcast but since it was the middle of the afternoon the visibility was fine. We were about 30 yards from where the path opened up to a lake. We were just walking and chatting and, unannounced, this creature walked out of the left side of the woods (no excessive noise, just a little bit if rustling like a deer was moving around) it then crossed the path and moved up into the right side of the woods. No drama, no growling or screaming... it did nothing to spook us. It just quietly and matter of factly walked from one side of the woods to the other. It did not look at us or do anything threatening. It was only about 6-6.5 ft tall, fairly thin (lanky almost.. the best way to describe it I find is to compare it to an Irish wolfhound dog on two legs, without the dog shaped facial structure). It had longer, stringy hair. The most striking part to me and what I remember most clearly, is that it's hair was grey, not brown. It was a dirty-grey type color. I did not see any facial features distinctly. It's gate was long-strided, the arms were longer and I remember they swung by its sides in an ape-like manner. The entire encounter was fairly short and unassuming. We saw this creature walk calmly across the path, no one said a word but we all wheeled around and ran the entire way back to the house.. I just remember being genuinely scared. I know I was young but I know I saw something that I struggle to comprehend or explain even today.

As I drove along, I noticed ahead in the ditch line, an animal.  I know that there is a mule that often gets out nad roams the area, so I slowed down considerably so as not to hit her. As I got closer, it stood up, facing my Explorer.  Instead of moving into the headlight beam as a deer or something would do, it came at an angle from the ditch, towards the passenger side of my truck.   It was in my estimate, at least as tall as I am (5'8\") covered with hair.  The hair was a buff or light color. All I really remember at that point is hitting the lock button on my doors and screaming.  It came up to the passenger side window and I could see it's chest.   If I saw the face, I do not recall it, just the chest in the window.   I was screaming and hit the accelorator and sped away as fast as I could.   I don't know what it was, only that I have never seen anything like it before in my life. But, it does make me wonder about events that have happened around our house in the past.  In the spring of this year, my dogs started going crazy barking and I stepped out onto the porch to see what was wrong.   I hear a scream that I took to be  a mountain lion.   Knowing that I had a dog in the back pasture, I went to my truck and went to the back to let her into the main pasture with the other dogs.   I noticed on my way down to the back pasture that my very large dogs had all of my goats in a tight knot by the small barn and the dogs were in a semi-circle around the goats.  When I got to the back, to let the other dog in, I noticed that there was no sound at all in the woods nearby.  My dogs were silent.  The dog that I went down to get was terrified and rushed through the open gate as soon as I opened it.   I went back to the house and went to bed. The next day the neighbor told me that my dogs had fought something behind his house at about 3 am.   He didn't know what it was, only that it was large.  When I checked my dogs out, they did not have the slash cuts they would have had, if they had tangled with a mountain lion.  There were scrapes but that was about it. Our fence at the back of the place was also pushed down.  Our fence consists of cattle panels that are 52\" tall.   They are hooked to the post with heavy wire ties.  I can not bend the ties with my bare hands.  At the place where the fence was pushed down, the panel was loose from the post and the clips were in the brush.   AT the time I thought it odd, as a mountain lion would not have been capable of doing this.  A bear could, but not a cougar.",

I heard what sounded like what I've heard the investigators on FINDING BIGFOOT do when \"callling\" to a bigfoot.  It was coming from about 1 mile away from the Tombigbee Water Way.  We're on the west side of the waterway.  We're in a rural area and are accustomed to hearing a variety of animal noises but, I've never heard this sound before.  We hear coyotes all the time and I suppose it's possible this could have been a coyote but, it struck me as being a sound like I've heard the investigators making on tv.  I heard it twice during the time I was out with the dogs and even mentioned it to my husband when I came in. Please understand that I did NOT see anything.  I only heard what sounded like what I've heard on the television show which sounded nothing like what I'm used to hearing out here.",

      "OBSERVED": "I’m always doing outdoor activities, floating, camping, hiking and recently I’ve had some strange encounters.  First, I like to go conservation areas frequently, and at wire road conservation area off of Grisham ford rd. In Crane,  I was there with a friend it was just after sunset when something would throw very large rocks into the Crane creek. that’s all it consisted of is splashing into the creek.  It sounds like  bowling ball sized rocks being thrown into the water making not only a splash but a “ker-plunk” noise.  This really made me and my friend wonder what was making this noise.  We were very open-minded about what could cause this noise and it happened on multiple occasions, all shortly after sunset when no one else was at the conservation area.  We told several people about this and of course everyone would say its probably just ducks, but like I said the objects in the water were very large making a “ker-plunk” noise like a cannon ball. Just as we finally had given up on the search for the cause of the splashing, months had gone by and me and the same friend went on a float trip. It happened to be the forth of July in 2008.   We planned to float in my canoe on Flat creek from Jenkins bridge all the way to a low water bridge on flat creek road (a very long float).  The float started about mid-day and about half way through the float is was very dark and cloudy so no moon light.  It was just pitch dark on the creek and at a slow deep section of the creek we were just quietly floating along not talking when it seemed like we startled something very large about 20ft. Away. It was just standing in the edge of the creek when we startled it, so it stepped out of the creek. You could hear one leg pull out the water followed by one more, and it displaced a lot of water making waves. It made a couple more steps up on land into a very forested area.  Me and my friend were stunned, just remaining dead silent and starring at the area were the noise originated.  Then, a very large rock was thrown within 5ft. Of the boat, exactly like the occurrences in Crane.  Even though we never saw the creature, It was very clear that it was a large bipedal creature because of the very long strides out of the deep water.  It seems that we startled it, so it walked just out of sight not really frightened though, then it threw a rock to warn us to get away.",

While we whispered about what to do, it must have heard us.  It started to run in our direction.  Whatever it was, it ran past our tent on TWO legs.

Farmers whenever they plant a field they leave an area between the field and the fenceline not plowed so they can turn their equipment around to get the next row.  In this area we saw something had walked in the grass next to the field that had large steps but didn't think anything of it till we came across a small wash out that had brought dirt out of the field into the area of grass into the path of the creature that had walked in the grass.  There we saw the largest footprint I had ever seen in my life.  We looked around for more tracks we could make out beside the one, but we lost the rest in the woods because it was starting to get dark.  The print was long but not extremely wide.  Like the stupid kids we were, we did not get a cast of the print and did not go back that way for a long time, but after that incident we were creeped out about going out in the woods without a weapon with us even still to this day",

      "OBSERVED": "This happened about 1982, in the area of Steelville Missouri. We were camping on the Meremac River. The group consisted of myself, my wife, my son, my daughter and a friend and his wife. The place we camped was on an elderly ladies farm. There were about 5 other campsites, all about 30 yards apart, with our campsite being on the end and closest to where the woods became thick. There was a dirt road that went from our spot into the woods a short distance. While myself and my friend were gathering fire wood, my son...about 7 at the time, sat at the begining of the road playing in the dirt. My wife said all of a sudden he looked down the road, jumped up and made a bee line for her, all the time yelling \" Mommy a big black man. My friend and I heard him screaming and ran back to camp to see what was wrong. I know my son was young at the time, but I'd never seen him so upset. He kept repeating that he saw a big black man standing part way down the road. Now at the time, we lived in St. Louis and my son was used to seeing black people but he insisted this man was differant. After we calmed him down he told us the man was real tall. Way taller than me or my friend, who was about 6'2'. He also insisted the man wasn't wearing clothes but was covered with black hair. My friend and I were both armed and decided to take a look down the road. It was getting dark by then and we didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary except it did smell like something dead was close. There was to be a huge meteore shower that night so we walked out into a pasture to have a clear view of the sky. The pasture bordered the woods on our left, with our camp and the river to our front. We hadn't been sitting there long when we heard something heavy walking around in the woods. At first we thought it might be a stray cow but the more we listened it sounded more like the way a man would move. What really got our attention was that all of a sudden we heard limbs snapping. Not small ones but big enough to sound like rifle shots. I'm a Vietnam Vet and a long time hunter. I've never heard anything move through woods like that. It spooked us enough that even though we were armed, both carrying .44 cal hand guns, we didn't venture into the woods to investigate. That ended our star gazeing and we spent most of the rest of the night sitting in camp with our pistols close at hand. The next day we found where something had bulldozed it's way through the heavy bush and left some good sized broken limbs and saplings in its wake, but to be honest we didn't look too close. Also the smell of something dead was gone. The rest of the camping trip was un eventfull though I did notice one thing. The lady who's land we were camping on was carrying a 12 gage shotgun every time we saw her. She even had it across her lap when she'd sit on her porch. Never knew her to do that before. She was of old hillbilly stock and not one to scare easy so I asked her about it. She just replied she wanted it close and would say no more. To sum it up, My son's insisting he saw a very big hairy black man, the way it frightened him,the noise that night and the broken trail of brush and limbs, the smell and the elderly ladies keeping her shotgun  close at hand, I have to wonder. Especially since I read, here on your site, of other bigfoot sightings in the area.",

As I came around the curb, I had the National Preserve, Meramec State Park to my right. As I looked ahead some 70 to 100 feet and I saw this tall monkey with long legs go by under one of the lights. I immediately looked to my right at the three line as fear overwhelmed my body. I turned around, pacing myself back towards town, trying to make sense of what I saw. It stood about 7 feet, and it was hairy, the hair of the arms was hanging 3, to 4 inches, it was the only part of the silhouette that was clearly hairy and I could notice clearly that it had ape like hairy arms. I went back to the house and researched the subject on you tube, but most of the videos showed a much heavier set creature. A lot of people that I talked to just can not believe me. Last night I came across the Jacobs video and the similarity struck me. I know that is hard to believe what I saw and I myself was a skeptic of this phenomenon, until it happened to me.

      "OBSERVED": "Two friends and myself were driving back roads in our home town out of boredom in the evening. We stopped at a small conservation area known as Riverside off a dirt road that shares the same name. There is a boat ramp off the Meremac River and a picnic table about 50 yards off the road and obstructed by woods and brush. There are trash barrels at the location and fishermen empty their coolers and discard fishing waste when they take their boats out of the water. There are farms and residences in the area, but nothing for about half a mile due to the area's proclivity to flood. There have also been incidents of violence in this location in the past (person on person) so there's a local aversion to the area, which makes it particularly absent of people at night. The three of us were talking and walking down the boat ramp to the edge of the river (the trees and brush make the ramp the only place that the river is visible in this area). There is a small gravel bar/island that is heavily wooded about 200 feet from the edge of the boat ramp where the river forks and splits. There was a decent amount of moon light and we were watching the water. We heard some noise in the brush on the island or maybe the opposite bank. A few moments passed and what sounded likes a rock hit the bank on our side (maybe fifteen or twenty feet down river) followed by what sounded like another rock landing in the river (presumably in the same vicinity of the first rock). We froze for maybe ten seconds, then we heard what we all collectively determined to sound like an ape yowling from about the same direction of the noises and rocks. I would say the sound was more like a one tone, moderately deep exhale or grunt that had a shrill undertone that gave it an aggressive feeling. We left immediately. We've all lived in rural areas for most of our lives and know the sounds of local wildlife. This sound wasn't one any of us had encountered before. We never saw anything.",

      "OBSERVED": "My mother and I had taken my young Doberman to the Honey Island Swamp to let him run and get some exercise.  We had driven to the end of the road where the bridge had collapsed and you could not go any further back by car.  The area is a few miles from the Honey Island exit off of Interstate 59 in Mississipi. The road was built up about 8 feet from the ground since it flooded back there.  The area around the road was swampy and had a lot trees.  The ground was covered in leaves since it was fall.  We had been there about ten minutes and my dog had been pretty much just staying on the road as he ran around.  I went to get something out of the car and when I started walking back to where my mother was on the road, she was looking out into the wooded area at something.  She pointed out what appeared to be something dark beside a large cypress tree.  We could not make out a head, but it appeared to be a grey/black fur covered torso.  Whatever we were looking at was large because it stood above some bushes and the top part was behind the branches of the tree.  It had to have been well over 6 feet tall, since the bushes were at least 3 feet tall.  It was definitely not another tree because the texture was so different from the big tree it was next to.  It was approximately 1:00 pm and the sun was bright.  The light was dappled through the tree cover, but we could see that it was shining off of what appeared to be hair or something with a \"hairy\" texture.  It seemed to shift back and forth, as if you were to shift your weight from one leg to another.  It was probably 50 to 75 feet away from us, so we could not get a real good look at it.  We did not hear or smell anything and my dog did not seem to notice anything out of the ordinary.  After looking at it for at least 2 - 3 minutes, we got very uncomfortable and decided that we would drive a mile or so up past one of the bridges on the way back to the interstate.  We put my dog in the car and drove at least a mile up the road before we stopped again to let my dog back out.  We had been there approximately 5 minutes when we heard footsteps in the woods.  We could hear them getting closer.  This time, my dog picked up on the sound and became alert.  We could hear it stop and then move forward a few steps a couple times.  We could not see anything, but my dog was definitely trying to figure out what he was hearing.  We got a little scared, so we loaded up again and this time drove up to where there are some nature trails and a shooting range (probably at least 1.5 to 2 miles up the road).  We got out of the car again and were not there 2 minutes when we heard what sounded like something running through the woods toward us.  At that point, my dog got so scared that he ran back to the car and hit the closed car door to try to get back in.  My mother and I ran to the car and all three of us got out of there as fast as we could.  We never saw what was making the noise in the woods, but whatever it was, was big enough to make a lot of noise both walking and especially running through the woods.  After leaving and having major discussion about what had happened, my mother and I got our nerve up to go back to the end of the road later that day (about 4:00 pm) to see if what we had seen earlier was still there.  When we got there, we could not find what we had seen before.  We saw what we are pretty sure was the big tree, but we didn't see what was by it originally.  We were not brave enough to go down into the wooded area for a closer look, so we basically left with even more questions than we started out with.  We never had a clear view of what we saw, but what we heard, definitely scared us.",

It had a greenish yellow eye  glow. The face was wrinkled with a broad nose.The head was pointed and appeared to have almost no neck.Very broad shoulders and large muscle.As I managed to get around the creature I could still hear it screaming in the distance.This is an event that will be with me the rest of my life.",

It was just about day break, Iwas 20 or so feet up a pine tree when I heard what sounded like someone beating a stick against a tree. I spotted some movement in the area the sound came from,What ever it was was brown and tall,my first thought was its a bear.I was using my binoculars,but it was about 200 yards from me and dawn.So I pulled up my rifle to look threw the scope,hoping I could see it better.It wasnt any bear, it didnt have ears on top of its head and its face was flat. It was at least 8 foot tall and stood like a man.and I noticed its skin was grayish/green where the hair was thin. I was so startled I stood up.It turned toward my direction and knew I was there.It leaned Its head back as if smelling  the air, then took off. It move 40 or so yards in a few seconds and was gone.I was shaking badly and climbed straight down.I just coundnt beleive what I had seen.So I started walking in the direction I had seen it.I walked over to a hill where it had slid and left a track. It was a human looking foot track.This scared me because I was trying to tell myself, it was just a bear,then a sound came from the woods that sounded like whoop...whoop.So I hurried back got my stand and left those woods. That has been six years ago, and everytime I told anyone my story. They made fun of me, so I been reserved about letting anyone know, but recently.A freind f mine had an encounter,he doesnt want to let anyone know.Because he thinks people will think hes crazy...

      "OBSERVED": "Subject: White Bigfoot I just read the Louisiana encounter on your site and thought it great that someone else had seen a white bigfoot. I have not told anyone outside of friends about my experience, although there were plenty of others around at the time. This encounter happened, Ohhh bout 30 years ago in Columbus, MS. I and several of the neighborhood kids were out playing in my front yard. I was the oldest, so the rest of the dozen or so kids were 4th grade and earlier in school. All of us were playing \"Tag\" and to make things level-out for the younger kids, we all were turning round and round to get dizzy so the youngers could have a fighting chance of  catching us. All of a sudden, my youngest brother ran through the group yelling \"Booger-Bear!!\" He looked TOTALLY scared to death. I thought he was joking, but then my next brother did the same while pointing toward the unoccupied side of out duplex apartment house. Soon, I looked around to find that I was the only one left in my front yard, the rest of the kids had run to where the parents where outside chatting next door. All of them were holding onto his/her parent(s). Well, I looked down the street and saw nothing unusual. Looked again, both ways, same result. As I was turning back toward them, my eye caught a movement beside my duplex. Something was standing at the corner, hugging it as though to peek around a corner. It appeared to be slightly hunched over and yet the top of it's head was at the top of the window. The top of that window was at about the 7ft plus level. Could have been higher. One day I might get a chance to measure it cause the house is still there today, although the neighborhood is not where I would care to be at anytime nowdays. Anyway, I stood there looking, trying to figure out what this white hairy thing was. Earlier in the year, maybe a couple of months (been a long time ago), there was a report of a white gorilla that had escaped from a circus. Thing is, kids know when a circus is around in those days, and I had never heard of one being anywhere near. It was just standing there, slightly moving kind of side to side. Since it was at dusk, and I couldn't really tell what this was that I was looking at, I slowly backed over to the grown-ups area. Eventually, the thing was hidden from my view by the house. I eventually worked up enough courage to make a wide arc toward where I saw it to see if it was still there. Nope, it was gone. I had a terrible time sleeping that night. Didn't want to be anywhere near a window even though we had no AC and it was warm weather. Next morning, I went to the area just to see if I could find anything. Nothing. I was never late for supper again. Never stayed out after dark. etc...The experience is real, though I have questioned my brothers about it and they remember nothing. Perhaps it was the grownups playing a joke?  They of course deny any knowledge. This is my only \"bigfoot\" story, though I have a couple of others that may spark some interest, one of which defies any rational explanation.",

ON THIS ROAD WE STOPPED TO ANSWER THE CALL OF NATURE. ONE GOT OUT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AND THE OTHER FRIEND AND I GOT OUT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.

My father was living in Ocean Springs and working for Littons Ship Systems in Pascagoula. I had joined him there from Arizona when I decided to try my hand at pipefitting instead of Mining. I had bought an acre of land and put a trailer house on it before I had my wife join me. We were on the south side of town in an area of bayous. One night we were at my Dads place playing dominoes when we ran out of diapers for my baby daughter. It was only about a half mile from Dads to my house, so the wife and I jumped in the pick-up and went to the house for more diapers. I had two Red Bone hounds penned in the back of the house and when we got there they were barking as if they had something treed. I was curious as to what they were barking at, as they seldom barked while penned. When I got out of the truck, I noticed a rancid smell coming from the back of the house. I ask my wife what she had given the hounds and she said nothing that smelled that bad. I left the truck running and we went into the house and gathered the new diapers then back to the truck and left. We didn't give it anymore thought that night. I didn't pay much attention when we got back home later, but didn't remember smelling anything then. The next night we were back at my Dads playing dominoes again, and listening to the news from the TV. We heard a report from Pas Christian that a woman had called the police and reported a hairy ape looking man outside her backyard, looking in her kitchen window. She said it was looking over her back fence, which was six foot tall, and she could see it's head and shoulders above the fence. Also, the kicker was that it was accompanied by a rancid smell like rotting meat. The same smell I encountered around my house the night before. Wow, was that weird. I looked around the next morning, but couldn't find any tracks or anything around the house. And there was no smell of rotting meat to be detected. I think we had a close encounter.",

There was only natural light, but the thing was only about twenty or thirty feet away and I can still remember it vividly. It was squatting down eating the vegetables from the plants there. I could even hear it eating from where I stood. A moment later we all screamed in surprise and shock at what we saw. It looked up  at us and kept right on eating. I remember that, by its mannerism, it had no fear of us what-so-ever and made no attempt to leave the area or hide in any way. What I remember was a creature that was built like a human being. I can't say exactly  how big it was, but I know it was bigger than the average person. It was covered all over with dark, shaggy, brown hair and when it  looked up at us as we stood in the window its eyes glowed white in the darkness. Eventually my Grandfather woke up and saw it,  too. He went out the side door with his gun and fired up into the air. We continued to watch out of the window and then saw the creature stand up and run off on two legs into the woods toward the river. I remember it ran so fast that I could hardly believe  it. The next morning we found very large human-like footprints in the garden.

The stories he told went back as far as WWI and included among others, my grandfather and my father. They never got a good look at the thing(my father always attributed it to bootleggers)but my grandfather said whatever it was, it drove lumbermen out of the woods and beat panther hounds so bad that they didn't come home for days. When I was little, I listened to the old people describe the thing and it didn't register in my mind until I got older that it sounded an awful lot like a sasquatch. I've heard there's something in Lousiana, and with all the primitive waterways that cross that two states, I wouldn't be surprised if the two aren't connected. The Burns Booger as they called it has been absent from the area since the sixties when the lumber companies went high tech. This is the same time the last panther was heard in Attala County. My great grandfather and a man were logging in the area after WWI and something frightened them so bad that they quit logging and refused to go back in there. My grandfather and father along with some coon hunters saw something standing by a dieing fire that they had built. They said it looked like a man but then it didn't. (My memory is hazy) on the exact descriptions. My father's coon hounds were known to hunt panther, but something tangled into them one night setting the dogs to howling in pain and terror. Before my father or grandfather could get to them, it was over. The dogs didn't come up for days. All the old people I heard the stories from saidthere was something in those woods, but the old people are all gone now and no one's heard from the Burns Booger in years.

      "OBSERVED": "Unfourtunately, I have no video or audio, only personnel observation. The first encounter did not involve a sighting. As a young boy, I was out on the front porch with my mother, father, uncle, and grandfather. At around 9:00 pm, we all heard a sound that was not unlike a shrill human scream. Untill that night, I did not know what it meant to have your hair stand on end. A somewhat large dog that we had outside barked, cried, and ran away in apparrent terror. The only thing we found the next day was a single partial footprint. The next encounter happened when my cousin and I were in the woods fishing at a pond on our grandfathers property. We first noted a very strong odor that we took to be a skunk. We then heard a sound like a scream, a few grunts, then nothing. Before the next encounter, there were some unusual incidents that deserve mentioning. First was the finding of dead livestock, mainly pigs. They almost always had been found with their liver and heart removed. I never saw this myself, only heard the stories. I did see on at least two ocassions all of the fruit eaten off of trees on the property. In both cases, all of the fruit was removed from the trees, and the pits on the ground around the tree. We laughed about the belly ache something would have from eating an entire tree of green pears. Later, as a teenager, I was alone in the woods. I had the distinct feeling I was being watched. I crossed a barbwire fence near the road, crossed the road and entered the woods there. When I returned to the road a short time later, 20-30 minutes, I saw that the fence I had earlier crossed, had been partially knocked down. Upon approaching the damaged fence, I noticed several \"large\" footprints. They appeared human in every respect except for their size. Even then, I wore a size 12D boot, the prints were at least two to three inches longer and maybe two inches wider than my boot. The tracks led first to the road, then back into the woods. Maybe a year later, a friend and I were in the woods. He was from New Orleans, LA, and knew nothing of the past encounters. While near a creek bottom, he suddenly froze and ask me what was watching us. I stood near him and saw what I first thought was a bear about 25 yards away. It was in a squating position. It then stood upright. It was, I'm sure, seven to eight feet tall. The creature was covered with very dark brown hair over it's entire body, with the exception of it's face. It stood upright like a man, not stooped like a bear. As we departed the area, we watched it follow us. The creature had a long stride and it's arms swung as it walked. It followed us to the edge of the wood line. The only sounds it made were whistling noises. My next and last encounter did not occur until I was in the army. A co-worker and I went to the old house to do some shooting. We arrived late that night. As we sat outside talking, we saw a large man shaped creature walk accross the road about 125 yards away. It walked into the woods and disappeared. It did not seem to notice us.",

It was a bright sunny afternoon either the last weekend of Feburary or the first weekend in March. The time was 3:55 PM on a Sunday. I remember the time as I had just looked at the clock on my dash and we always exchange Jessica on Sunday. We had been following the river for some time and I noticed the ice was breaking up from around the edges and floated down stream. My daughters 15 year old boyfriend was traveling with me. We were traveling west on highway 135 at aproximately 60/65 MPH towards St. Regis. As we started over the bridge that spans the clark fork river I looked to my left as I always do. I like to look for deer and other wild life along the river bank. There is a sand bar that reaches out into the river on the west side and near the tip I saw a very tall (8 to 10 feet) hairy being and a much smaller one. It looked to be right at or just  taller then the knee of the larger one. The larger one was standing about 5 to 6 feet behind the small one with it's arms outstreched and taking a step forward. The small one looked as if it was curious about the chuncks of ice that were near the waters edge as it was leaning forward looking down. The tall one had long reddish brown hair. I remember seeing it flow from the upper arm area, and the hair on it's head and shoulders was also long. It looked silky and shown in the bright sun light. The small one looked to be the same color with shorter hair. When I saw them I said to my daughters boyfriend, \"Look at that!!!\" He said \"WHOA!!\" then we were over the bridge. We looked at each other with our mouths open. We didnt turn around, I think we were stunned and didnt quite believe what we had just seen, maybe a bit scared too?. We didnt talk about it on the way back. After picking up my daughter, the two of them were excited to see each other and talked non-stop in the back seat. I did look at the sand bar on the way back over the bridge which was about 30-40 minutes later, but I didn't see anything. I didnt tell my husband about this until a few weeks ago. I'd been trying to convince my self I didnt really see what I saw. Then one night at dinner I told my family what I had seen. My husband said, \"YA RIGHT!\" My daughter's boyfriend happened to be there for dinner and said, \"Kelly, I remember that, I was there with you!\" He and I hadn't talked about this until that night. I knew then I had to send our siting to the BFRO. I totally believe that what he and I saw was a mother Bigfoot and her young child. I got the feeling in that brief moment, that she was showing her young one something new, allowing him or her to explore. Perhaps her baby had gone too close to the river and she was reaching out as if to say \"that is far enough!\" Just as I have done with my own children.",

      "OBSERVED": "My half brother Shawn Flaten, my friend Monty Yellowbird ( a local Black belt karate instructor from South Dakota), his younger brother( forgot his name, and myself(Kevin Martin),all were hunting on the reservation (I am a tribal member and we could hunt year round). We had decided that we would go by a place I had picked (by the Stiffarm residence), which was down by the river. The river the Missouri about 30 miles or so from the FT Peck dam, had some good areas that a fairly thick in brush, open fields and Cottonwood trees. I was told by various tribal elders not to go down to the river at night, but since we had rifles I didn't really think about danger. We were on the old Indian highway heading west and then we drove about one fourth mile past the Stiffarm's residence and turned South down a road that dead ends after about another quarter mile. Montie's brother said to let him off at an irrigation canal that ran due east/west he was to walk all the way east until the open field on his left and the brush on his right ran into the trees. The trees that the irrigation canal ran into was a \"deep\" woods area that hardly anyone went into, mainly because it was owned by a non Indian and partly because it was a little spooky and quiet. Monty , Shawn and myself stopped the car at the turn around spot and got out. We then headed South and crossed a barbed wire fence and got on another irrigation canal ( parallel to the one Monty's brother was on). It was about 5:30 PM just about enough time to get a deer and get out before dark. We started walking east and passed a block of brush to the left and came upon an open field. Monty said that he was going across the fields to the east, right below were his brother was and start flushing in the brush that was all on the east border of the field. We bid him good luck, and continued on. I told Shawn to set up on the south east corner of the field next to the irrigation canal and wait to see if one of us flushed something. I continued on and went pass the block of brush Monty was in and turned North. The river was on my right and the brush was on my left, and I started walking up the lane. About this time, I knew that I had miscalculated the light and it was getting dark fast. The road up ahead was dark and it went into the \"thick forest\", right at the point were the irrigation canal that Monty's brother was on entered the woods. I was walking slow listening and then all of the sudden right in front of me about 100 yards ( sound guess) there was this horrible and very loud screaming. The sound was deep and had gurgling noises mixed in with a hooting like a chimpanzee. The sound was right on top of were I had mentally placed Monty's brother to be. I was told by our elders to stand your ground as a warrior if one of those ever came to you. I looked at the .22 in my hands and a broad yellow streak went up my back. I spun around and took off back to the canal. I ran around the corner and about 150 feet later ran into ( almost literally) Shawn. He said later he almost shot me, and we ran west on top of the canal. We stopped about right in the middle of the field on our right and spotted something running towards us from about were Monty went in the brush. Shawn said \" should I shoot it \", then I said \"yea\". Shawn drew up his gun and was taking aim when he decided to wait a few more seconds. Its a good thing because Monty came running all out of breath, and said \"do you guys hear that?\". All the while it was continuing to scream, gurgle and hoot unlike anything I have ever heard. We ran all the way back to the car and piled in. We took off north and met Monty's brother already standing on the road. He was shook up pretty bad and we asked him what happened. The weird thing was that he never told us, then, nor later on. Monty though it was us for about 2 seconds and then decided based on sheer terror that no human could make those sound that long. It was definitely the closest and most chilling, as far as immediate danger goes. I never saw Monty or his brother after that, and even my brother and I don't talk about it much. I am spooky about the military, because the people that filmed them in this location before were professionals, and the Indians I talked to said that they even got daylight footage, yet nothing was ever in the news. They even had pictures of a group of them, yet nothing.... That is why I am spooky about it.",

      "OTHER_STORIES": "I heard one looked in a window of a residence due South of Frazier's railroad crossing. Another supposedly attacked a man about 1 mile West of that location. The local residents have stories of one of the creatures looking in the windows of some of the houses on the river. There is even one story of one man being slapped around by one of them at a local fishing hole while a group of guys were drinking. It was said the thing came out of the water behind him and that it hit him as he turned around to see what his friends were yelling about. I don't know about the stories but this was about the third kind of Bigfoot I have heard in my life. I heard others when I younger and after that at a Ceremony in South Dakota. I even met a man that was struck by one, he was in the ceremony with us. I asked one of my brothers what the white man was doing there and then he told me the story. If anyone ever wants to meet one, I know where a lot of them live. The only thing is that when a bigfoot crew was there before, they didn't get much day footage. Come to think of it I think they could have been with the military, because they had plenty of expensive (night vision)equipment. The only way I would go is if someone offered me (serious money), because I \"seriously\" don't want to go back there. I met enough Indians, that would tell you the same thing. We as a people have known of them for centuries, but we leave them in peace as they are messengers or if you meet the \"other ones\" bringers of bad happenings. You can believe me or not, I am probably the only one from my reservation brave enough to say my mind. I and my brothers have had plenty of experiences, to scare me for a lifetime. I guess according to the old people I am not a warrior yet. After all would you stand and pray while one walked up to you? I know people that have and they have my respect.",

I was driving from Houston Texas from a job interview, I had been driving all night long, and My Mom was with me because she decided to go, and we were almost home when it began raining. I'd say we had about 20 more miles to Meridian, somewhere between Enterprise and Meridian on Interstate 59..I was going about 55mph because of the rain. I noticed a large figure to the left of the Jeep running towards us. I looked at my Mom and asked her if she had seen what I seen, and she said yes. I asked her to describe what she had seen and she said that she had seen a large hairy man, or something running at us. We both came to the conclusion that it had to be a bigfoot. I hunt alot, and I have never seen anything like this in my life. I believe that what we witnessed that night was truly bigfoot... This creature looked to be about 8 ft tall...

      "NEAREST_TOWN": "Quitman, MS",
      "NEAREST_ROAD": "US Highway 45",
      "OBSERVED": "At the time of this occurrence we had been at Clarkco State Park for two nights in a cabin. The previous morning, Wednesday, October 20, 2010, I had walked the length of the cabin road to its dead end, turned around, and then walked the length of the cabin road all the way across the dam to the park headquarters building.   During this time I shot photos of leaf colors, a duck on the water, and various other things.  Nothing unusual was seen or heard that morning (morning of Wednesday, October 20, 2010). The following morning (Thursday, October 21, 2010) I awoke around 730AM.  My wife was still asleep.    I had a bite to eat, put on my clothes, got my digital camera, and headed out on the road towards the dam of Clarkco Lake to get some early morning photos.  The time I left the cabin was about 815AM CDT. The temp was down around 45 degrees that morning and there was a light fog coming off the lake.  The morning was completely clear – brilliant sunshine - with no overcast and some light breezes now and then. I tried to sneak up on some turtles that were out on a log to shoot a photo, but they were too quick for me.   All of them slipped into the water.  I shot a few photos of the lake, leaf colors, and the fog from the south end of the dam (the end away from the park headquarters building). After shooting several photos I headed back to the cabin on the road that led away from the dam.   When I was about 150 feet from our cabin I heard a distinct knocking sound like you would get if you were hitting a 2x4 with another 2x4, or maybe hitting a 2x4 with a hammer.   I thought there might be some carpenters doing some work at a house located nearby.   However, we were inside the state park and I knew of no houses – other than the ranger houses - within the park.    This knocking sound continued on.   I didn't count the number of \"knocks,\" but I'd say they numbered at least ten knocks and were in a steady rhythm. I stopped walking and looked directly into the wooded, hilly area in the direction the sound seemed to be coming from (towards the south).   The knocking stopped when I stopped walking.   I saw nothing and heard nothing while I was stopped on the road.   There were no odors in the air at this time either.   As mentioned above, there was a light breeze blowing from time to time that morning.  I then proceeded to walk to our cabin which was only about another 75 feet away.   As I began to walk the knocking sound started again and this time I attempted to count the knocks.   There were five or six knocks in a steady rhythm.  Then there were no more. When I got into the driveway of the cabin I again looked in the direction that I thought the sounds came from and saw nothing. Could this sound have come from construction work between the state park and U.S. Highway 45?   Could there have been a utility company crew working in the woods on a power line? I have been in the woods for years as a Scout leader, a camper, and as a hunter, I have heard woodpeckers and other animals make noises before.   This was not a woodpecker.   It was not a deer hitting a tree with his rack.   This was a heavy and deliberate sound.  This knocking sound was unlike any animal sound I have ever encountered. There were no \"whoops,\" \"calls,\" or other noises, just the wood knocking sound.   The knocking was a \"hard\" sound almost like a carpenter hitting a piece of wood repeatedly with a hammer in a steady rhythm.   That's one of the reasons I lean towards it being a sound from a construction site.    However, the fact that the knocking stopped when I stopped walking and looked into the woods, and then resumed when I began walking again, makes me think there are other possibilities as to its origin. After coming home from the state park I listened to wood knocking sounds on the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization website.   The wood knocking sound I heard exactly matches the recorded wood knocking sounds on some of the bigfoot websites.  Again, the sound was similar to hitting two 2x4s together or pounding on a 2x4 with a hammer. During midmorning of that same day we left the state park and went to Meridian for a few hours.    My wife was not feeling well when we returned, so when we got back to the state park we packed our belongings in the car and headed for home.   We had paid for three nights at the park, but we only stayed two nights.  We left the park around 330PM CDT that day.   I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary the remainder of the time we were in the state park. The GPS coordinates where I was on the cabin road when I heard these knocking sounds are approximately: N  32 degrees, 5 minutes, 53 seconds     W  88 degrees, 41 minutes, 44 seconds.",

Probably about 400 yds. into the woods.  I wasn't swimming I was sitting down at the side of the water hole with my feet in the water but kind of drawn up beside me and my sister was sitting between my legs in the water.  We were all just playing around being pretty loud and I don't know if I heard something, caught some movement out of the corner of my eye or what, but my attention was drawn to a large bush on the other side of the \"swimming hole\". I sat there staring at this bush for a good 30 or 40 seconds maybe a full minute, before I realized what it was I was seeing.  There was a face looking at me from behind (between) some branches.  The face was very big, flat, dark brown almost black, eyes were black. I thought at the time that the eyes were looking at me with curiosity or amusement.  It didn't look evil, menacing or well you know. I don't remember a mouth or nose.  I remember the hands being huge, gigantic, the size of baseball mitts.  It seemed like I was looking at it for minutes or longer, but couldn't have been that long, and all of a sudden I was just terrified.  I picked up my sister and screaming ran out of there and everybody just followed me out. I was the only one who saw it, my friends wanted to know why I was so scared.  I told them it was Old Man Walker, (A hermit who supposedly lived way back in the woods, and would shoot at you if he saw you), and they were o.k. with that.  I didn't want to believe what I saw but it defiantly was not an old man. I found it very comforting to know I was not the only one to have seen something so frightening. Thinking about my encounter I was in no way threatened and I don't know why I was so frightened, but to this day I still wake up with night mares. Thank you.",

We had ascended to the top of the cliff via a steep gulley and enjoyed the view from a flat topped buttress. There was one 4-5' juniper on the flat area. As we were returning to the car we hiked into a meadow about 3-400 yards from the cliffs and turned around to look at where we had just been. I was suprised to see that in addition to the lone tree there was another dark form that was swaying back and forth. I thought to myself, \"thats cool, there's a bear up there\". Then the \"bear\" stood up and walked off the flat area down into a small rocky notch and up some steep rocks then disapeared into the timber. It apeared to cover the distance in about 4-5 strides with very fluid motion. We hadn't spoken yet, only 10-15 seconds had passed. All we could say to each other was, \" I thought that was a bear!\" and to remark that the hair went up on the backs of our necks when the \"bear\" stood up. We hiked back to the truck and had calmed down enough to eat a snack while sitting on the tailgate. We were about 3/4 miles from where we had seen it.

      "OBSERVED": "On the morning of October 21, 1978, my dad, uncle, cousin and I awoke in preparation for opening day deer season. After spending the night in my Grandfathers cabin up Alder Gulch, we geared up for an early morning hunt. My cousin and I rode in the back of my uncles pick-up truck with my dad riding shotgun. We planned on hunting the ridge to the west of my Grandfathers cabin. We had to drive about 2 miles south or as I would call it (up) Alder gulch to get to the road that goes to the ridge. We missed the turn to the ridge road, but quickly realized our error. Upon finding the correct road we progressed up the gradual slope climbing and meandering through mostly pine and some meadows dominated by waist-high sage brush. Of course, being opening deer season my cousin and I were being vigilant scanning every opening and meadow. My cousin and I were hanging on to the cab of my uncle's truck due to a slight uphill grade. To our right was an open hillside meadow covered with thigh high sage brush surrounded by pine trees. We both were scanning the meadow when my cousin said, \"there's another hunter, (slight pause) why is he wearing all black?\" All I could do was stare and keep staring. My cousin looked over at me because I had not said anything. We both viewed the animal for about 10 seconds. About 250 yards out in the sage brush meadow was a bigfoot. We banged on the cab so my uncle would stop. The pick-up came to a quick stop and as luck would have it, there were pine trees blocking our view from the sage brush meadow. We immediately said to back-up. As we backed up my cousin and I expected to see the bigfoot still in the meadow but there was no sight of him/her.  We both looked at each other in disbelief and questioned each other as to what we saw. Make no bones about it the animal had the distinctive dome shaped head with no neck broad shoulders and solid black. The animal was facing us and slightly bent forward and looked as if it was resting it's right arm on it's right knee. It occurred to me that he/she knew it got caught out in the open and was just going to stay motionless and hoped we would drive right by. The closest tree line was about 50 yards away from the big foot and it had taken us only about 15 seconds to get back to were we could see the sage brush meadow again. We didn't see the big foot again.  We didn't tell our dads until later on and just kept it to ourselves. My cousin and I continued to hunt deer that morning with a constant thought in the back of our minds of what we saw earlier. We did separate from each other as we hunted the ridge and I did get an eerie feeling that I was being watched. Hustling to find my cousin down the ridge and put the feeling of being watched behind me I heard a gun shot. My cousin did get a nice mule deer buck. This was about 2 to 2 1/2 miles from our sighting. I have hunted most of my life and have seen most animals that live in these woods. My cousin has been hunting all his life and knows every animal there is in these woods as well. We will never forget that morning and talk about it with each other occasionally.

A call(scream) began and rose and fell over the length of about 10 seconds that silenced all 5 of us and everything in that forest.  The hair on my neck stood up.  Then it repeated. A few minutes later, we heard it again. It sounded like it was coming from the ridge above us. Starting like the growl of a bear, it rose slowly in pitch and strength over the 10 seconds until it peaked in a howling high-pitched scream. A survey was taken and no answers were to be found as to its origin. The next day, we summited and on the descent we discovered a cave only about 15 feet deep and lined with dead pine needles. No discussion was ever made by any of our party until a few years ago. Last summer while car camping with my son not far from the first incident, we heard rocks being pounded together just after dusk. It went on all night and even the next morning before we could get out of bed. I looked around and couldn't even find the rocks they had been using. The dog barked when the rocks were being used, but wouldn't go to investigate.",

      "OBSERVED": "I had hiked downstream on the Missouri River from Hauser Dam for an evening of flyfishing for rainbow trout. This was during August, 1977. As usual, I kept fishing until well after dark. About 11:00 p.m., there was no moonlight and it was so dark I could only see a few feet in front of me. I had a large flashlight/lamp with me which I laid on a large boulder with my flybox. Just below the boulder, I placed some rocks in a circle near the river's edge to put my trout so they would keep fresh. I was fishing about 20 yards upstream of the boulder that held my lamp when I suddenly realized that I had lost my fly. I proceeded back towards the boulder to put on another fly. As I approached the boulder I could see some kind of movement but it was too dark to make out what it was. When I reached the boulder, I switched on my lamp with the beam pointing above the boulder towards some brush up the steep embankment. I was startled to hear a crackling sound and see movement from the brush. I pointed the beam directly at the movement only 10 feet from me and got a full view of a hairy bipedal creature moving very rapidly up the bank and quartering away from me in the downstream direction. It was very large and muscular with long dark hair and seemingly no neck. Estimated height is about 7-8 feet, guessing 400-500 pounds. I could not see its face as it was moving away from me. It took long, powerful strides and its arms moved powerfully as a man would walking very rapidly. It was amazing to see how quickly it traversed over the boulders and up the steep embankment. I had the creature in the lamp beam for only a few seconds before it disappeared into the darkness. I was stunned at what I had just seen and tried to rationalize what it could have been. For some strange reason, I felt absolutely no fear. The sense I had was that this was an animal of some sort that was frightened away by my light and posed no threat to me. However, that changed somewhat when I shined the lamp towards the rock pool where I had been keeping my trout. Before the sighting of the creature, I had four trout ranging from 2 to 3 pounds in the pool. After the sighting, there were only two trout. This explained the movement I detected as I was approaching the boulder. The creature must have been innocently foraging along the river's edge and found an easy meal. What caused me some concern was that the creature might come back and fight for the remaining two fish. Then I heard a boulder crashing down the hillside, probably several hundred yards down the river. I therefore felt some comfort that the creature was still running away from me. At that point, I picked up the two remaining trout and hiked back up to Hauser Dam and crossed the river to my vehicle and went home. I have only told this story to my wife, a couple of close friends and to a bonafide researcher in Helena.",

      "OBSERVED": "I can hardly remember the date,but I do remember the events leading up to the sighting. It was a very warm fall day when my cousiins and myself decided to some huntng on horseback. The area that we hunted was the foothills of the rockies on the Blackfeet Reservation in Big Sky Country. We had decided half way into the trip to just take a ride a wait for lady luck to bring us something during the ride. All day was pretty good as far as the ride went but I know that everybody still had the idea of getting a deer on their mind. We had decided to ride hime through a brushy trail hoping to run into some game before we made it home. Most of the day was gone and the evening sun was warimg our backs as we made our way home. As we approached the trailhead my cousins horse was relectent and fought the briddle bit for awhile. We thought it was just because of it being green broke. Once inside the brush a good ways into it our horses started stepping very softly and snorting once in awhile as if something didn't agree with sence of smell. I could see the opening of the trail and it would also be the end of the trail. One of my cousins was just about to say something when our horses began jumping in different directions like they were scared of something, the first thing on all our minds was, A BEAR! We began looking in different directions trying to get find the location of the bear. I don't rememder who was the first to sight what it was we saw, I just heard him swear and ask the rest of us to look. We looked in the direction he was pointing and saw this very tall thing running on two legs beside us and then turned in front of us. The thing crossed the trail in front of us about 40 feet and stopped at the edge of the brush, it just stared at us as if in the same amount of amazement as we were, and then just disappeared into the trees just as fast. The best way I can describe it as probably the hairiest man I have ever saw well past 6 feet tall. It was hard to determine the size but the branches the we found broke the next day were from 6 feet to about 8 feet in some places some foot print were found in places where the ground was soft and along the trail we followed towards the mountians. This was the only sight we had since then and this was when I was 14 years old I am now 30 and probably the first one to tell anyone what we saw that day.",

We started south of Bozeman and planned to finish in Yellowstone latter that summer. This was our third weekend and it being a Sunday we were hiking out to our car which was parked at the Portal Creek access. It was getting late in the day and it looked like some weather was rolling in. We were coming down the west side of windy pass so we decided to double time it so we weren't exposed in the weather. We didn't make it to the tree line before the storm hit us. The wind was howling and a nasty mix of rain/hail came down on us. When we were well enough below tree line we decided to sit out the storm by this rock out cropping. Wind whipping through the hills, especially in a rocky area like this, has a very distinct sound. It seemed like there was something else in that in that howl. Something that didn't quite sound like it was part of the wind. No one commented on it but I could tell by how Dan and Kevin were looking around that they heard it too. After about 45 minutes the wind died a bit and only a slight drizzle was falling. We started hiking back down, the clouds were clearing and it looked like we were gonna get a good view of sun setting over the Spanish peaks. We were coming through this clearing that had been cut maybe ten years ago. The sun was almost out of sight when we heard some thrashing across the clearing. It could have been almost anything but since we were in bear country Kevin took out his .357; not enough to stop a determined grizzly, but it was better than nothing. We proceeded slowly across the clearing. It was maybe a hundred yards towards to older tree line, with a lot of scrub and young pines in between. I was looking up for circling carrion when I heard this howl. It sounded like what I had heard earlier but now the wind wasn't behind it. It sent a chill up my spine. Dan, who was behind me yelled something to the effect of \"holy [#*$%]\" and pointed off to our right. Something massive and dark and clearly running on two legs ran through the brush about sixty yards away and disappeared into the forest. I don't think any of us moved or spoke for about five minutes until we heard the howl (yell?) again (this time pretty far off and in the opposite direction than we were heading) We got out of there in a hurry. We didn't tell too many people about this when we got back to town. We did return back to Portal Creek access the next weekend to start our hike again and I've been back to that area several times since hunting or just out of curiosity and I've never heard or seen anything unusual.",

The reason I am writing this is because I listened to the \"Whoops and Knocks\" recording from CA, and it reminded me of what I heard while I was hunting on Tuesday afternoon. I was hunting with friends in the Swan Valley of MT. I do not know the exact location, because we were in the backwoods, and traveling on back roads off of Highway 83. We were on the east side of the highway north of Condon and I beleive south of town Swan. My Partner and I split up (our other partner was in his truck up the road). He was to my left 150 yards and in front of me by 200 yards. I saw something brown in the corner of my eye pass behind a tree to my right, hoping it was a deer or elk, I started to head in that direction. My partner contined heading toward and through a ravine. I would walk, and then stop for about 10-20 seconds looking around. I kept hearing a knocking sound. I thought it was a very close woodpecker, but could never see one.Plus it was really loud. After I decided that I must of lost the deer or elk, I decided to head down into the ravine my friend has been went through about 5-10 minute before me. The knocking sound became loud and I was sure that it just was very loud wood pecker, or deer ruttings(The rut is not for a couple of more weeks). The sound always came from the right of me. After hearing knocks on the recording in the Seirra Mountains, I am about 98% sure that is what I heard. Wood or something hitting wood, which also explains the volume and pacing of the knocking. I walked down into a ravine and it got a littel louder. Then all of sudden the knocking just stopped. I decided to go find my partner and walked out the ravine to the other side. I could not find him, so I went back through the ravine, and heard more knocking.I walked back somwhere between 1/2 to mile to our drop off point on the road (I came out about 100 ft to right of the spot), and thought I heard and elk call (which none of my partners heard) but sounds very much like the whoop call after the 1/2 point of the recording. The two men I was hunting with are expereinced hunters and in the woods. It was my second time hunting.  I told them about what I thought was the elk call, and neither of them heard it. When I heard it I was probably atleast 1/2 mile from them. I did not mention the knocking, because I though it was bird, and no big deal. I have hiked/backpacked in Tenn,CT,NC,AZ, The Cascades in WA, Grand Coulee Dam Area of WA, and enjoy being in the woods. This is my first time that anything like this has happened.

We hiked about a mile and a half up into the mountains and about half way up, we crossed a little creek about 4 to 5 feet wide. I stopped and pulled out my phone to take a picture of the upstream view. I got the picture and we continued on without realizing what he had just done. Later that night I was going through the pictures of that days hike, when I came across something in one of the pictures that was extremely startling. About 45-50 feet from where I took the picture, there was a black figure that seemed to be sitting near the bank of the creek looking right as us. Curious about what I had seen, a few days later when my father arrived to visit my brother, I took him to the place I had taken the picture. Sure enough, where there had so clearly been something sitting next to the creek, there was nothing. In fact there were even freshly broken branches off trees that were no where near the spot it was sitting.

My boot measures exactly one foot, and four and half inches wide, and my average step is about three feet. I am six foot and one inches and had to leap to reach each track. I'm guessing it had a rough estimate of a five foot step, which were heading north, north east up the mountain. I know it wasn't a snowshoe because snow shoes are so long that they overlap themselves, and have a hinged claw in the middle for traction which these tracks showed no sign of. Each step was long and clean, bearing no signs of drag. I guessed the tracks to be about 4-5 days old. I side hilled the mountain heading south, then down to the road back north, only to see my tracks being the only ones up off the road since it snowed. I've never crossed another person's tracks up there before, since its a pretty secluded area that has hidden lakes for the willing hiker. But never a track like this one ever.

      "OBSERVED": "It all started in the summer of 1982. Mt .St. Helens had erupted earlier about a year or so before. Myself and my cousin my brother and a family friend decided we would go hiking. Me and my friend were both 15 at the time and my cousin was 14 and my brother was 13. We went into the woods carrying nothing but BB Guns. We could not see nothing at the time. But I had been hiking in those woods about 5 years by myself or with my brother and I never had a care in the world.This included a run in with a grizzly. I felt as if we were being watched. For some reason the hair on the back of my neck even stood up. We could not see anything at the time so we continued on. Well a thunder storm started in and we started back towards my cabin. I gues we went out about 2 miles before we had to start back. I still feel as if something or someone was watching us. I just knew it. But whatever it was did not make a sound nore would it let us see it. Well we kept on and finally we heard something in the woods ahead of us. Well we stopped and to be honest were scarred so we stayed put for awhile and just listened.Well the noise stopped and we continued back towards the cabin this time a little faster than normal. Well when we finally broke out of the woods about 400 yards from the cabin I looked towards the end of the woodline and I saw a fiqure standing up and looking at us. My friend also saw it as well as my cousin, and my brother. It was black in colour and looked to be at least 6 foot tall. It was about 200 yards away from us so we did not know if it was a bear. well we went back to the cabin and told our parents what had happened and they had no explanation for it. My mother grew up there and she had no idea. Well about two days later we got brave again and on a bright sunny day our same group headed out in the same area. Well we got about 300 yards in the woods and we came upon a footprint. It was in the mud and well formed like a human print. Well I were a size 12 shoe and have since I was about 12 years old and I put my foot into the print and it was a good 4-6 inches longer than mine and a lot wider.Well I know what a bear print looks like as well as prints from the various animals in the area and the bear print was as close as I could come up with. But it had more human like toes not the long claws that you would see with a bear. Well we decided to get the heck out of the area. We then walked back out of the woods and back towards the cabin. Instead of walking the area of the woodline we took a path across the field. All of a suden my friend stopped and tried to speak, he almost turned pale white and he could not talk. He pointed into an area in the woods. I finally saw what he saw. Sitting on a old tree stump about 5 yards into the woods was what I believe to be a bigfoot. We were only 50 yards away from him and I could see clearly it sat there looking at us, and well it looked in another direction while we were starring at it and it was like he did not have a neck he moved his whole upper torso and then looked back at us. Well when he did this we took off running. I am now a police officer and have been for many years, and I still have never been as scarred as I was that very minute. When we got to the cabin we told my friends parents as well as my mom what we saw and what had happened. Well my friends dad got his pistol, and I got my dads 7mm. Deer rifle and we went back out, it was me my friends dad, and my friend. Well we went back into the wooded area and looked around for about an hour or so and found nothing. We then proceeded back out of the woods the same way we did when we saw this thing on the stump. Well I looked up towards my cabin and saw my mom she was waving her hands and yelling so I waved back. Well you have to know my mom she does not I repeat does not run for anything. Well she took off in a sprint towards us and when she got about about 100 yards from us she yelled that the creature was behind us.Well I turned and looked with my dads rifle reasy and I saw the back of the creature just for a second go into the woods. We then went back to the cabin and repported this to the local game and fish dept. They responded later that evening and we took the game warden to the area we were at. We could not find the print we had seen earlier, and I think he thought we were nuts. Well about he time we were coming back out we found a bush that had been layed float as if something had been sleepin there and it smelled. This was the only time I smelled anything. It smelled like real bad body odor mixed with urine and feces. Well we did not find anymore evidence. I have been back in the area many times. I do go out with a rifle but would not shoot this creature. I feel that if this creature was harmful towards me it could have killed me many times in the woods. We did have some people come from another state about a week later and ask if we were the ones who did the report and we told them no. I don't want a bunch of gun-toting idiots out there trying to hunt this thing. The way I fiqure is it has been there a lot longer than me and I need to respect its home",

About 8-10 years ago 6 (six) of us were hunting south of Indian Meadows trailhead. We were basically hunting across the rough and timbered area in pairs. Brad and I heard the noise in the distance. It sounded like a high pitched scream related to a rusty gate being opened slowly. There was wind and unsettled weather. It was in the afternoon! Later we learned that the others in our group also heard it, even closer to them. Steve and Miles had their wives with them as we combed the varying terrain searching for Elk. Everyone had highpowered hunting rifles. Steve and Germaine apparently got together with Miles and Cheri and decided to take the first main game trails out of the area. Steve was an avid bear hunter and was very disturbed about what he heard. Brad and I continued the hunt, really not getting the full impact of the sound effects. I heard the sound one other time in the same area. Miles and I were hunting elk with the bow and arrow and I had something come into my calling and never had the opportunity to see it close to the same area. No one had a visual on the animal. No tracks visible even at times when the snow was on the ground. We have all heard stories about creatures crossing the roadway early in the morning, other sightings and very rank smells in undergrowth areas. In relation to our hearing the vocalization, Miles spoke to me on the telephone on day about a television program about Big Foot and someone that had a recorded soundtrack of a believed big foot scream or call. Miles indicated that his wife came from her place of rest in the other room and stated, What was that noise? Miles replied to her, that was a recorded sound of a presumed big foot or Sasquatch. Cheri replied, \"That is the sound we heard hunting across from your Dad's house. Miles' dad's house is one of the last homes before you reach the wilderness boundary. The area you have documented near Stonewall Mountain is very close to this area. I hope this information supports believed big foot sightings in this area.

I opened the back door and let the dogs do their morning business. About 50 feet from our back door was a large hairy man like being. The dogs saw it as well and came running back into the house. I stood still on the stairs watching it. I think I was in shock by what I saw. The animal then turned and looked right at me and let out this scream/holler. It was the most frightening thing I have ever encountered. The yell struck every nerve in my body. I was so scared that it instantly made me cry. I felt like I was getting this fight or flight response. Never have I been this scared in the woods. We get to see many different animals here in Montana but nothing like this. The animal was about 7-8 feet tall, and had brownish black hair covering its body. The hair was probably about 4-6 inches long. I would guess that it had to weigh 500+ pounds. When it let out that yell/scream at me. I got the feeling that it was angry that I saw it. The face was like that of an ape but with very human features. I stood frozen to the stairs as it moved off down the hill. The experience probably lasted only a couple of minutes. It walked on two legs and was no bear! Never have I been so scared by something in the woods that I have cried. I have come face to face with bear and elk and mountain lion. I was scared in those situations too, but not like this. When it let out that yell/scream was what really touched a fear in me. I dont know that I am able to do justice to be able to tell you the way I felt at that moment.",
      "ALSO_NOTICED": "As it turned and when it walked away. I could see the muscles moving under the hair. It was well developed.

We have been hearing this thing up here for years. We have been laughing and joking that it is a bigfoot. Never did I think I was going to hear and SEE one so close. I know it was no bear, but a bigfoot. I am as sure of this as I am my own name. We get to hear it on a pretty regular basis. We have lived over here for about 6 years and have been hearing it all this time. We just never really knew what it was? Also- when this thing is in our area. Our dogs will not go outside. They have chased bear off the property, treed a mountain lion. But what ever this is? It scares the heck out of them. Also- the local native americans have talked about this thing for years. They call it Windago, and when in the woods won't let their children go out at night. A couple last remarks. There have been a couple nights where we have had small rocks thrown on our tin roof of our home. We also get to hear what sounds like a small tree or log or limb being hit against another tree.

I have made it a habit to keep track of where the ranchers have their cattle near the highway so I know where the elk will or will not be. On my way back I was driving about 60 mph while scanning a ridge side and tree line where I had seen elk before when I noticed something very out of place and very dark running along the tree line. I don't know whether it was cause I was in disbelief or I was just being a good driver, but I literally did a triple take after noticing it. It was about 230 to 300 yards away and I could make it out quite well. The thing was on two legs, had very long arms that seemed to end barely above the knees, its head was positioned as if a person were sticking their neck out, and it ran while barely moving its arms. It didn't look like it was alarmed, just as if it were just going along its way heading back into the mountains. In scale to the trees I'd say it was about six a half feet tall.  I watched it for about ten seconds or so ( as much as I could without wrecking, don't know why I didn't stop) and there's no way it was anything else.

      "OBSERVED": "It has been awhile since this incident happened (1989), but I remember it well. The incident occured during the summer of 1989. I was working in my father's woodshop when my older brother (19 at the time) burst through the door. He was nearly out of breath and very distraught looking. He immediately demanded that I come outside right now. I asked him what was wrong but he just said, \"Come out here right now! Quick!.\" I hurriedly followed him outside. It was late afternoon and the sun was just beginning to wane in the deeper parts of the forest. I asked him what was the matter. He told me to sush, and said \"listen!\" I could here that our grandparent's dog was going berserk. I could also recognize the bark of our dog in the distance as well. I asked my brother what was going on with the dogs and if they were fighting again. He said, \"SHHH! Not the dogs, listen!\" We were both silent, I didn't here anything. I asked him what I was supposed to be listening for. He said he heard something really weird, really freaky. I asked him what it sounded like. He said he could'nt really explain it, just that it sounded really weird. I told him that maybe he heard a mountain lion, as I had heard them on several occasions. They make a really strange sound like an inhuman woman screaming bloody murder. He said it didn't sound like a scream. He took off running down the road towards our grandparent's house calling for me to follow. I ran after him. Halfway to our grandparent's house I heard the sound. We both stopped in out tracks. I yelled to him \"What the hell was that?\" He excitedly replied, \"That's the sound I heard, that's it!\" I had heard a lot of strang sounds growing up in the deep woods over the years (elk mating calls, ruffed grouse beating their wings, coyotes, etc.), but never anything like this. I can't really describe the sound except that it was a high-pitched tone from a living thing that was very resonant, powerful, and well controlled in its execution. It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. Soon, whatever it was out there in the woods ahead of us made the sound again, this time for a shorter duration and slightly broken. Another period of silence (other than the dogs going nuts). We continued running towards our grandparent's house. We soon arrived where the dogs were. Our dog was standing next to our grandparent's dog which was tied up. They were both looking and barking into the forest in the direction we had heard the sound coming from. I had never seen them bark like this, not even at bears. All of sudden, we heard a similar sound come from a completely different direction of the woods on the opposite side of us. Immediately the call was answered by another loud report where we originally heard the first sound. Whatever was out there, there seemed to be two of them and they seemed to be communicating. We continued to listen. Nothing for a minute or two. Then we heard two more distinct calls, this time from the same general direction in the woods, yet seperated. They were now coming from a farther distance. Again they seemed to be replying or communicating to one another. We continued to listen for several minutes, but the sounds did not occur again. We told our family members about it but no one really paid much attention as they had not heard the sounds and since we lived right in the middle of an area used by bears and other animals to travel through the wilderness regularly (the tribe caught 7 bears in one summer using live bear traps near our house!) they probably assumed it was just some animal out in the woods. In any case, I have never forgotten the incident and often think of the surreal event every time I go back to the wilderness.",

The sun was shining. The reason I went out side is this, my dogs started to bark and run through the house they got half way through the dog door stopped an whined. I thought that was odd so I went and sat on the back porch. Then I saw the tree to my left move and the tree was about 300 yards away from me or less I am bad with measurements.  So I watched the tree to see what caught my eye and then I saw the creature.  It was behind the tree looking out from behind it.  It's head was in the banches and it was hunching.   Is's head was large and it had a definate brow I thought I was seeing an oranatang.  Except it was about 6 and ahalf feet tall.  It was moving it's head aroud the tree to watch me as I stood up to get a better look. It's hair was a rust color like to color of dead pine needles, It's eyes were haunting. And it was completely silent.  It was watching me while I was watching it.  I sat back down.  I watched outside for about 6 minutes and didn't tell the person on the phone. Then I went in the house and watched throught the window to make sure it wasn't a trick of shadow.  Then the creature moved in front of the tree, staying hunched over but watching me in the window. I watched a few more minutes and then went to the back of the house when I went back it was gone.  While this was going on my kids were in the front yard playing in the water.  I think if the creature had been aggressive it would have made some sort of move. but it d=seemed peaceful. It seemed to be curious I think it was young to be in such a vulnerable open area. When my husband came home we went out to the tree and all of the knapweed was completely trampled down around the tree. We didn't find any hair though.

Both of us are in our mid-thirties, married and have children.  Neither of us however, drink, use drugs, or in any way were incapacitated during the time of the 'sighting'. It would also be relevant to tell you that I grew up in Washington where I spent countless summers camping, hiking, and enjoying the outdoors.  My good friend grew up in Oregon and spent a great deal of time hunting, camping and recreating in the outdoors. We both now live in Missoula, Montana and have never heard the sounds like we did last night, on 01/23/2005. My buddy and I returned from a coffee at Barnes and Noble and he was dropping me off in my driveway near 2030 hours.  The moon was pretty full last night and it was cloudless, so visibility was pretty good.  Behind my new home, which sits on nearly two acres, is a large hill that descends on the other side to a partially wooded area in a canyon where deer are seen all the time.  The heavier, more dense forest starts less than a mile away, and in fact heads into the mountains. As we conversed in my driveway, the COMPLETE silence was broken by this god-awful howl/growl/moan that echoed the whole valley. The volume was overwhelming.  Immediately, my dog, as well as multiple dogs on the road, began barking and almost seemingly panicked.  Now please let me tell you that we get elk, deer, bear and mountain lion around here pretty consistently, but never any reaction from the dogs like this. We went behind my house where my dog was no longer barking, but instead just shivering and looking up at the hill - just as 'it' did it again.  The sound is so incredibly similar to the 'howl' you have on your site that it is eerie. A third series of growls (and let me tell you they were deep and extremely loud) soared across our neighborhood. I let my dog have refuge in his fenced kennel where he retreated to his doghouse.  My dog is a year old lab who has grown up exposed to many wild animals. We waited but the noise finally stopped after 1-2 minutes.  We both commented on how the hair on the back of our necks were sticking up and that neither of us had heard ANYTHING like that before in all our years. My friend left and I headed into the house where I felt compelled to load hollow point slugs into my shotgun.   For nearly thirty minutes I noticed my dog staring up on the hill but did not hear another noise for the remainder of the night.",

I don`t know exactly how big or how much it could have weighed but I do know the hands of the animal hung to about the tops of the fence posts it was walking next to. Those posts are about three to four feet of exposed post There were two of us who saw the creature walking. After we passed it I said, \"what the heck was that?\" My friend responded by saying, \"I don`t know what you saw but it looked like chewbacca to me\". Instead of pulling over and continuing to watch the creature or flag someone down to see it for themselves, we just kept on driving. I will never frogive myself for this and if I ever have another encounter I will definately act differently. I now live in Portland Oregon, the heart of Sasquatch country. This sighting has provoked an interest in me to find out what is out there. I know something is there.

I had to hit the binders hard.   It wouldn't look at me.   Just stood on the left shoulder of the road.   It did kind of look over it's shoulder at me but I didn't get any facial features.   It swayed when it turned. I did notice that it had long hair, almost like it was groomed. Probably 8-10 inches long.   Couldn't tell you what color it was because it was almost midnight and it was in the headlights. The next day, I had to make a daylight run.   I stopped and measured bushes, fence, and such.   This thing was at least 8 feet tall.  I looked for hair on the barbed wire, or tracks.   Nothing. This happened in the old town of Decker Montana.   Decker was moved with the coal strike.   I remember where the old town was.  When you are driving North, you drop over a hill and the town was on the left.   My mother in law used to have the restaurant.   But it's gone now.

Thinking it was our dog, Whitey, I tried to dump the breakfast scraps on him.  I missed by a couple of feet.  I then turned around to go back in when I heard a scuffling sound.  Thinking it was our dog eating the scraps, I turned back around to see.  But instead I saw a creature that was taller than me, and I was standing on the porch.  It had to be at least 7 feet tall, covered in an off-white fur - except for an oval around the face.  Unfortunately, I don't remember what its face looked like.  Its arms hung almost down to its knees.  I dropped the frying pan, and tried to scream.  Nothing came out.  The animal turned back to look at me as it was loping in slow motion around the side of the house.",

      "OBSERVED": "I was hunting a creek bottom,called the little Shocco Creek. The creek bottom is heavily forested,and a dense crop of a bamboo like reeds grow along the bottom. I was leaving the woods,but stalking slowly along a logging road. As I started up a hill,a doe deer that was bedded down just above the reed cane (on the side of the hill),jumped up and headed for the thick cover of the reeds. The deer was angling to my right,and down into the reeds. I quickly got to higher ground,above the reeds,in hopes of seeing the deer as she slipped through the reeds. As I was watching her white tail waving through the thick,green and brown cover,something to my extreme right moved,and on the other side of the creek. I could not really understand what I was seeing. I saw a tall,(in comparison to the reeds,which grow at least 4-6 ft tall)figure moving away from me,and it appeared to be dark,and sort of mottled in color. The mottling was not in highly contrasted colors,but simply darker shades of brown,and slightly lighter shades of brown.Maybe it was the effect of the sun filtering through the leaves. It was the early part of the deer season,and the leaves had not fallen entirely. I estimate the distance to maybe 50 yards. Being above the reeds,was the ONLY way I could have seen this. As I watched it move through the woods,it appeared to have what I would call a hump on it's back,and I only saw that when it turned and looked in my direction,as it pushed through the vegetation. I had the perception that it went through some very heavy limbs,as I saw them snap back once it was through. It did not seem to be running,but moving quickly,and with no need to duck or dodge the vegetation.It just pushed through it. I will admit,that I was unbelievably unsure of what I had seen.I was scared to be honest. At that time,and as it is now,black bears were NOT known to inhabit that part of our state. And,black bears do not walk very far in an upright manner.This was upright. I did not go back into that bottom again. I hunted a very large clearcut area that afternoon,and I could see for several hundred yards in each direction. I was armed with a heavy caliber hunting rifle,and armed with a .44 mag. revolver,and I would not venture back in there again I have seen no tracks on the creek bottoms,or around muddy spots,that we could not identify. As far as I know,area residents ,my immediate family,have not reported any thing similar. I have several cousins that practically LIVE in those woods during hunting season,and have heard nothing,rumor or otherwise. Hunting with hound dogs, is still popular in that region,but no one has reported anything unusual being brought to bay,or treed,including bears.",

The print depth was deep enough to be distinctly visible in ambient lght. I spent some time examining the print to try to exlude other causes, knowing that water flowing over soft bottom can create patterns as can multiple animals walking over a path.

      "OBSERVED": "It was in January 2006 when a good friend, my 26-year-old nephew and I went camping on some private land in Stokes County near Pilot Mountain. This private land operates as a summer camp during the summer and hosts small retreat groups during the fall, winter and spring months. I attended this summer camp for many years as a youth and then lived and worked there during the off-season as an adult. In addition, I have been camping at this very spot a dozen times within the past few years. In the summertime, the woods at night are alive with the sounds of nocturnal animals, crickets and frogs. During the winter months when all of the leaves have fallen off of the trees, the woods are dead silent at night. The only sounds you can hear are the wind and the occasional dog barking in the distance. So after we set up camp, we ate dinner and sat around the campfire for a while. We climbed into the tent and went to sleep around midnight. I drifted off to sleep and was awakened at about 2:30am by my nephew tossing and turning. He told me that he had indigestion from the dinner we ate and he asked if I had any antacids. He asked my friend too and we both indicated that we didn’t pack any. He then said that he needed to get up and walk it off. My nephew then proceeded to unzip the tent flap and go outside by the campfire. By then the fire had died out and I could hear him scratching around in the ashes looking for hot embers and cracking small sticks to build the fire again. Soon, I could see the light of the fire flickering against the side of the tent and hear the crackle and pop of burning wood. It was at this time that the most unusual sound pierced the silence. The sound came from the woods immediately surrounding our campsite and it could only be described as a loud yelp.  In all my years spent camping on this land, some in this very spot, I have never heard a sound like this one. The souund was very similar to the yelp recorded on your website except that it was slightly higher pitch and was much closer. There wasn't any echo. Immediately after hearing this sound my eyes shot open and my nephew who was still cracking sticks around the fire froze in silence. My mind was racing to think of what could have made this sound when I heard the tent flap quickly unzip, my nephew tumble inside and then quickly zip the flap back-up again. The three of us immediately whispered to each other and then lay silent. The next morning and every time we’ve been camping since we’ve always had a good laugh at my nephew’s expense. After listening to your sound recordings, I’m just in total shock at what it could have been.",

      "OBSERVED": "It was a sunny but cool Saturday in November 1976. I was home for the weekend from college when my cousin Don and I decided to do a little squirrel hunting. Don had a 12-gauge shotgun and I had a 22-gauge rifle. I had seen a fair amount of squirrel activity around while fishing at a nearby farm pond and thought we would make this a fruitful trip. This is rural America with the nearest town of 1,000 just 15 miles away. It is also a farming community with large fields dotting the countryside and woods separating the fields. The area we planed to hunt is made up of mostly hardwood trees with cypress trees down near the river that flowed through the property. We walked about a half mile into the woods until we came over a ridge and started down towards the river which was about 75 yards away, all the while looking up in the treetops for squirrel sign.  I look down to insure my footing when I caught a glimpse of something off to my right between me and the river. Coming up from the river bottom was a huge dark mass. I froze in my tracks and my cousin bumped into the back of me. I could feel the barrel of the 12 gauge across the small of my back. Don looked around me and said, “what is that?” I couldn’t speak.  The mass continued in our direction taking long strides and ignoring the small trees, brush, and briars in its path, as if they were not there. It stopped about 30 feet from us. It looked upset that we happen to intrude in its space. I could clearly see its face, body, feet and hands. It had dark brown hair that was longer on its head and arms than the legs, chest and stomach.  Very short hair on its face, and the skin shone through.  The hair was darker the closer to the body it was. It looked to be about 9 to 10 feet tall with a very heavy muscular structure and weighing about 800 lbs. I am 6’1” and was about 4 feet higher up the ridge yet could almost look eye to eye with the creature. It then grabbed a dead old hardwood tree still upright which was about 6 inches in diameter in its right hand with its left hand placed on a larger oak about 20 inches in diameter. As it looked at us with yellowish looking bloodshot eyes, it snapped the old dead oak off at the ground and made a loud grunting bark. I could see it’s teeth with the canines a little longer than our own but not pronounced like a bear or dogs. I could even see vapor from its breath. I don’t think it could see mine because I was not breathing.  I didn’t smell anything and didn’t expect to, as it was downwind. I could feel the 12-gauge’s barrel getting pushed further into the small of my back as cousin Don was positioning himself with me directly between him and the creature. It seemed aggressive at first, but it did not get any closer than 30 feet. Like it wanted to send a message, which my cousin and I read loud and clear. We were not invited, so get the heck out of there! I was now ready for a hasty retreat as my legs started to finally move and the brain cramp I experienced seemed to lessen. As I turned around to leave, Don and I kind of got crossed up. We scrambled back over the ridge and ran for at least a quarter mile before we stopped. Don was hysterical. For a guy with a back as wide as a house, the screaming and tears just did not fit. I was trying to calm him down, at the same time trying to understand what we had seen.  As we both calmed down, and weak legged from just running the 440 along with the loss of adrenaline, we kind of just fell on our backsides. After a few choice words between two teenagers, we came to the conclusion that it probably was just a bootlegger in a gorilla suit.  That was just a show to mind us to stay away from some hidden moonshine still.  Why we didn’t shoot it was also discussed and we both agreed that it didn’t seem right. We are experienced hunters and you just don’t shoot to be shooting, and as far as we knew this think was not in season. It also looked too human.  I looked into the Bigfoot phenomena by purchasing the book “Bigfoot” by Ann Slate and Alan Berry. The accounts described by Alan gave me solace that I was not alone. Others were experiencing the same encounters. My conclusion still shifted back to the moonshiner theory, even as I felt the gorilla costume seemed to fit the moonshiner too well. So that’s the story we told our relatives. Even though it never seemed right or fit the experience, that’s the way I saw it. I left the area to go back to college after that. Never really returning. My brother built a house not 300 yards from where we had the encounter, and I plan to visit the spot from time to time. I guess in one way to hope for a chance encounter and in another way to relive the one I had. Man what a rush. After the demise of Ray Wallace, I felt I should tell this story now. Also in hope that others in rural eastern North Carolina that may have experienced a similar story might want to tell theirs.",

At approximately 12:30am I was driving south on I95 near exit 2 or 3 just a few miles from the South Carolina border with a tractor trailer approximately 400-500 yards in front of me. I had been following this truck for awhile when it looked like something had either been hit by the truck, kicked up or maybe a deer crossed behind the truck. In quick order, first the right taillight then the reflective material in the middle then the left tail light went dark and came back on. Instantly I cancelled the cruise control, steered my vehicle to straddle the center line thinking I would either have to avoid some debris in the road or avoid a deer that could be standing in the road and leaned towards the windshield to get a better look. As I approached the spot where this happened there was nothing in the road, but standing on the median side of the road was for lack of better understanding a Bigfoot! It was hairy from head to toe and huge. At least 7' tall. As I got closer it took two huge steps and went down the side of the embankment into the median. I was literally no more then 10-15' away from it when passing it. I was able to hit the high beams as it took the second step. This entire scenario played out in probably 10 seconds or so. I can not come up with a reasonable explanation for what I saw. It was not a man, no clothing and hairy plus the stride length was insane. I'm 6' 4\" and no way I could have a stride that long. It was not a bear, it was standing on two legs and had arms and hands. This thing was nearly impossible to see even with the head lights on high beam it was so black.

About 2 weeks later i was hunting a stream right down from this spot and heard a huge splash in the water and i thought it was a deer so i waited,but never saw anything about 20 minutes later I went up the creek a few hundred feet and in a place in the creek I saw 1 track again on a rock bottom creek very hard my track didn't show up when i crossed the creek but this track 20 plus inches was down about an inch into the hard rockbed bottom of the creek since it was only one track again I didn't bother calling the biologist back,but i saw other signs like stick formations,large patches of vegetation that looked like it had been rolled over by a steam roller,several tracks in the leaves with long strides about 4 feet,found where 2 animals had been killed looked like something put a deer up on a big limb about 8 feet of the ground you coud see the deer hide all over the limb and found where an animal had just been freshly killed one day hunting in there was only person up there that day and something killed an animal near the river it looked like a pile of manure had been steamed rolled into about a four foot wide area on the road about eight feet long and a lot of blood on the ground but no guts and no corpse and that strange smell was there every day.I have hunted a lot of places since i was 5 years old I am 44 now,but this is the only place i have ever hunted that gives me the creeps,I know of a few sighting close to this place,it's not far from the highway 220 incident yall reported and not too far from where the one in Montgomery county was spotted.I don't care to be interviewed by the media please but i believe I can show you where you can actually find Bigfoot",

      "OBSERVED": "I was spending the night at a friends house, after a day's hunting in the nearby woodlands and swamps. It was about 3:00am in the morning, when I awoke to a 'howling', or 'wailing' sound  just outside the house, coming from the direction of the woods. This lasted for probably 30 seconds to a minute. My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound. I was frightened, so I did not get up to investigate. It took my at least an hour to fall back asleep. I never associated this sound with 'bigfoot', until now. I downloaded the \"Howl.wav\" (http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm) file from your web site. It has a eerie howling sound, with dogs obviously reacting to the noise. I had chills when I heard this, because it was very similar, if not identical to the sound I had heard that early morning. I have played it over and over again. I am a hunter and outdoors man, and I had never heard an animal make this sound before. It was definitely 'organic' in origin. I never thought about Bigfoot living in this part of the state, because the surrounding areas are somewhat populated. There are, however, lots of rural swamp lands and forest areas. Although I have no further evidence to back up my claims, I thought this would be worthy to report. I'd be interested to know if Bigfoot really could exist in a coastal woodlands area, rather than the mountainous regions that the creature is normally associated with.",

      "OBSERVED": "I wanted to let you know about a sighting of Bigfoot I had in North Carolina. It happened about 1982, I was about 17 at the time of the sighting. It was in the fall, around October. First of all I should start by letting you Know I am what you would call a city boy. Scared and out of place in the woods. A friend of mine invited me to go Deer hunting with his father and him on a large parcel of private property they owned in North Carolina. I'm willing to try  anything, so I went. This Property was set back away from the closest road about a 1/2 mile on foot, before you even got to the cabins they owned. These cabins were on stilts, like a beach house about 10 foot high, with stairs. For what reason I have no idea although we were next to a small inland waterway. At about 5am in the morning we proceeded to go hunting, my friends taking me to my deer stand and moving on to thiers. This deer stand was about 10 feet high in a tree. I did see many deer and a black bear that day, but I didn't have the heart to shoot them. I guess at about 9 am My sighting began with a bad smell. It smelled worse than a dog that had been playing in a sewer.  Then I heard it before I saw it, snapping twigs as it walked, at first I thought it was my friend and his dad, come to rescue me from this ordeal. I only saw it from the waist up, from a distance of about 50 yards. And if It knew I was there, It didn't care. It stood in one spot for a good 5 minutes eating leaves, so I got a good look at it. Having seen a bear earlier that day there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY this could be a case of mistaken identity. This creature had hands like a human, that plucked the leaves it was eating and it looked very fussy about the ones it wanted. They looked dark black in color and relatively hairless except the back of the hand was hairy. It looked to be about 8 foot tall, and just unbelievably massive in the chest and shoulder areas. Its fur was very dark black in color. I only caught a glimpses of its face, as its back was to me, and it looked hairy except around the eyes. The neck was short and stubby with a kind of furry ridge that ran up the back of the neck, to the top of what looked like a slightly pointed head, that sloped down to the  forehead, like a gorilla I saw in the DC zoo. When I lost sight of it I could still hear it crunch sticks and leaves ,as it walked on its way for about 5 more minutes. Needless to say I was so scared I almost Peed myself waiting quietly for my friends to come save me. When they arrived, I told them the story, and of coarse they thought it was a bear. I haven't told this story to many people, because of the ridicule i received from the \"manly\" men of the woods that day.",
